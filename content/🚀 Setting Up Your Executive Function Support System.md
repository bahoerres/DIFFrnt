## 🚀 Setting Up Your Executive Function Support System

This guide will walk you through setting up the core elements of a system designed to make life with a neurodivergent brain a little smoother. Think of this as your starter kit – **you can adapt and expand upon it as you discover what works best for _you_.**

### 1. Core Notes - The Foundation:

[[🔋 Energy States - Understanding Your Brain's Power Management System]]
[[✅ Quick Wins List - Your Momentum-Building Toolkit]]
[[🍽️ Task Menus]]
[[🏠 Environmental Support - Designing Your Productivity Ecosystem]]
[[🛟 Crisis Management - The Impossible Task Protocol]]
[[🚨 The Momentum Activation Protocol - Navigating Task Initiation Challenges]]

### 2. Choose Your Tools:

- **You'll need a way to keep track of your tasks.** This could be a dedicated app, a simple notepad, or even a whiteboard.
- **Think about what you're already comfortable using and what fits your style.** If you're unsure, start simple – you can always switch things up later.

### 3. Establish Your Inbox:

- **Designate a central place to capture _all_ your tasks, ideas, and reminders.**
- This could be a digital note, a physical inbox, or even a voice recording app. The key is to have one place to dump everything without filtering.
- You'll process and organize your inbox regularly, but for now, just make it a habit to capture anything that comes to mind.

### 4. Define Your Contexts:

- Contexts help you categorize tasks based on where, when, or how you can do them.
- **Think about your typical environments and situations:** @Home, @Work, @Computer, @Errands, @Waiting For.
- Use whatever method works for you to tag or categorize tasks by context – this could be labels in an app, different sections in a notebook, or even color-coding.

### 5. Visual Timers: Your Focus Friend:

- Visual timers can be game-changers, especially for neurodivergent brains. Seeing time passing can improve focus and motivation.
- Find what works for you – a visual timer app, a physical kitchen timer, or even a simple hourglass.

### 6. Personalize and Adapt:

- **This is the most important part!** There's no one "right" way to use this system. Experiment with different note structures, task management methods, and tools until you find a combination that feels intuitive and supportive.
- This system is about working _with_ your brain, not against it. Don't be afraid to change things up as you learn and grow!

### You've Got This!

You've now laid the groundwork for a system designed to support your unique way of thinking and working! **It's time to start filling in the details, experimenting, and discovering what helps you thrive.** Remember, progress over perfection – celebrate every step forward and enjoy the journey!
