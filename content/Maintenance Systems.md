Would you like me to:
1. Create more detailed protocols for specific maintenance scenarios?
2. Develop emergency maintenance cards?
3. Add more burnout prevention strategies?
4. Create integration guides with other systems?

The maintenance system is designed to be both proactive and reactive, helping prevent burnout while providing clear recovery protocols when needed. It's particularly focused on sustainability and preventing the common ADHD/autism cycle of system abandonment and burnout.
