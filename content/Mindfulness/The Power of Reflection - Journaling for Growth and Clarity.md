It was a rainy Tuesday evening when I found myself staring at a blank notebook, pen in hand, feeling both excited and terrified. I was just a few days into 40, a few weeks shy of  5 years sober, recently diagnosed with ADHD, and increasingly suspecting I might be on the autism spectrum as well. My therapist had suggested journaling as a way to process my thoughts and emotions, but the idea of putting my complex inner world onto paper felt overwhelming. What if I did it wrong? What if I couldn't focus long enough to write anything meaningful? What if my words didn't accurately capture the intricate dance of my AuDHD brain?

As I sat there, the blank page before me seemed to mirror the uncertainty of my life - a life that hadn't followed any conventional script. My earlier years had been a blur of impulsive decisions, addiction, and a persistent feeling that I was somehow out of step with the world around me. Now, with sobriety under my belt and a new understanding of my neurodivergent brain, I was grappling with new questions. Who was I without the haze of alcohol? How could I harness the unique aspects of my ADHD instead of fighting against them? And how did potential autism fit into this complex picture of my identity?

Little did I know that this simple act of putting pen to paper would become a powerful tool in my journey of self-discovery and growth as an AuDHD individual.

## Why Journaling Resonates with Late-Identified AuDHD Adults

If you're reading this, chances are you've walked a path less traveled. Maybe you've battled addiction, struggled with undiagnosed neurodivergence, or simply felt out of sync with society's expectations. Perhaps you've experienced:

- The disorientation of realizing in your 30s or 40s that your brain works differently from others in multiple ways
- The simultaneous relief and challenge of getting sober, wondering how to process years of suppressed emotions and sensory experiences
- The feeling of being "behind" peers who seemed to effortlessly achieve traditional milestones
- A sense of hard-earned wisdom, coupled with uncertainty about how to navigate a world that often feels overwhelming

These experiences can leave us with a tangled web of thoughts and emotions that seem impossible to unravel. It's in this complex emotional landscape that journaling offers not just a practice, but a lifeline for AuDHD individuals.

## What is Journaling? A Safe Space for Neurodivergent Minds

Before we dive deeper, let's clear up a common misconception. *Journaling isn't just about recounting your day or venting your frustrations (although it can include those things)*. For those of us who've fought hard to understand and process our feelings, especially with the added complexity of AuDHD, journaling is a powerful tool for self-discovery, emotional regulation, and personal growth.

The practice of keeping a journal dates back centuries, with historical figures from Marcus Aurelius to Virginia Woolf using this method to explore their innermost thoughts. But you don't need to be a philosopher or a literary genius to benefit from journaling. At its core, journaling is simply the act of reflecting on your experiences, thoughts, and feelings through writing - a practice that can be particularly beneficial for AuDHD minds that often race with ideas and sensations.

For me, discovering journaling was like finding a map to navigate the complexities of a life that hadn't gone according to plan. It offered a framework for addressing the very questions that had been gnawing at me:

- How do I make sense of my past while building a meaningful future in recovery, considering my neurodivergent perspective?
- How can I use writing to manage the racing thoughts, intense emotions, and sensory experiences that come with AuDHD?
- What patterns and insights emerge when I regularly reflect on my experiences through an AuDHD lens?
- How do I find peace with my journey while still striving for growth in a world not designed for minds like mine?

## Core Principles of Journaling: A Guide for Late-Identified AuDHD Adults

### Honesty and Vulnerability

   For those of us who've battled addiction or struggled with undiagnosed AuDHD, honesty can be scary. We've often hidden parts of ourselves out of shame or fear, masking our true nature to fit in. But journaling provides a safe space for radical honesty:

  -  In recovery, we can explore our cravings, fears, and hopes without judgment.
   - With ADHD, we can pour out our racing thoughts without worrying about structure or coherence.
   - As autistic individuals, we can express our true feelings about social interactions and sensory experiences without fear of misunderstanding.
   - As late-identified AuDHD adults, we can acknowledge our feelings of being "different" without comparison to neurotypical standards.

   This principle invites us to see our unfiltered thoughts not as something to be ashamed of, but as rich material for self-understanding and growth.

### Consistency Over Perfection

   If there's one thing addiction and AuDHD teach us, it's that progress isn't linear. Journaling embraces this reality:

   - In recovery, we learn to show up for ourselves daily, even when it's hard.
   - With ADHD, we practice building a routine that accommodates our unique brain wiring.
   - As autistic individuals, we can create a journaling practice that respects our need for structure while allowing for flexibility.
   - As late bloomers, we focus on small, consistent steps rather than dramatic transformations.

   This principle helps us build a sustainable practice that grows with us over time, accommodating the ebbs and flows of AuDHD life.

### Reflection and Pattern Recognition

   For those who've used substances to escape introspection or whose AuDHD minds naturally jump from thought to thought, the journaling emphasis on reflection can be transformative:

   - In recovery, we learn to sit with our thoughts and emotions rather than numbing them.
   - With ADHD, we can start to recognize patterns in our behavior and thought processes.
   - As autistic individuals, we can trace patterns in our sensory experiences and social interactions.
   - As AuDHD adults, we can begin to untangle which traits might be ADHD-related and which might be autism-related, leading to better self-understanding.

   Journaling isn't about achieving perfect insight overnight. It's about creating a record of our inner world that we can learn from over time, especially valuable for those of us piecing together a late-in-life understanding of our neurodivergence.

## Growth Mindset and Self-Compassion

   Perhaps no journaling principle resonates more with AuDHD survivors and late bloomers than the emphasis on growth and self-compassion:

   - Recovery has taught us that every day is a new opportunity to choose differently.
   - ADHD aspects of our personality offer creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.
   - Autistic traits provide depth of focus and unique perspectives.
   - Our non-linear paths have given us resilience and adaptability that we can celebrate.

   *Journaling encourages us to view every entry as a step in our ongoing journey, approaching ourselves with kindness and curiosity rather than harsh judgment – a crucial practice for those of us who've spent years masking or trying to fit neurotypical molds.

## Practical Steps: Incorporating Journaling into AuDHD Life

### Start Small
   Don't overwhelm yourself with the idea of writing pages every day:
   - If you're in recovery, commit to writing for just 5 minutes after your daily check-in.
   - If you struggle with ADHD-related focus issues, try bullet journaling or stream-of-consciousness writing for short bursts.
   - If you have autistic traits, consider using structured prompts or templates to get started.

1. **Ask yourself:**
   - What's one thing I'm proud of today?
   - What's one challenge I faced, and how did I handle it?
   - What's one sensory experience that stood out to me today?

2. **Create a Ritual**
   - Make journaling a special time that accommodates your AuDHD needs:
   - Find a quiet space where you feel comfortable and safe from sensory overload.
   - Use stim toys or fidgets while you write if it helps you focus.
   - Keep your journal and favorite pens easily accessible, perhaps in a specially designated spot.

3. **Use Prompts**
   - When facing a blank page feels overwhelming:
   - Keep a list of prompts that resonate with your AuDHD journey.
   - Try completing sentences like "Today, I'm feeling..." or "If I could explain my mind to others, I'd say..."
   - Use guided journals designed for neurodivergent individuals or create your own templates.

4. **Embrace Imperfection**
   - Remember, your journal is for you alone:
   - Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or handwriting.
   - Draw, doodle, or use color if it helps you express yourself – many AuDHD individuals are visual thinkers.
   - Allow yourself to write "I don't know what to write" if you're stuck, or simply list sensory observations if narrative writing feels challenging.

5. **Review and Reflect**
   Periodically look back on your entries:
   - Notice patterns in your thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and sensory experiences.
   - Celebrate progress, no matter how small.
   - Use insights gained to inform your recovery, ADHD management strategies, and understanding of your autistic traits.

**The Ongoing Journey: Embracing Growth Through Words**

Incorporating journaling into AuDHD life isn't about becoming a great writer or having profound insights every day. It's about creating a consistent practice of self-reflection and growth that honors the unique wiring of our brains. There will be days when writing feels like a chore, when your entries seem trivial or repetitive. The magic lies in showing up anyway, in trusting that the act of putting pen to paper is valuable in itself.

Journaling offers us a way to find meaning in our struggles, to track our progress in recovery, to manage the complexities of our AuDHD brains, and to celebrate the unique journey of being a late-identified neurodivergent individual. It reminds us that our stories are worth telling, that our experiences - however messy or unconventional - have value.

As you begin or deepen your journaling practice, remember that your path - with all its detours and obstacles - has given you a unique perspective. Your experiences, however challenging, have prepared you to engage in self-reflection with depth and authenticity that is uniquely AuDHD.

I'd love to hear how journaling has impacted your journey. What insights have you gained through writing? How has it supported your recovery or helped you understand your neurodivergence better?
