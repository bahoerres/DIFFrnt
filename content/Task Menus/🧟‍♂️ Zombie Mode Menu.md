Zombie Mode is the state where your energy feels drained, your thoughts move sluggishly, and even the smallest tasks seem insurmountable. But this isn’t a failure—it’s your brain protecting you by conserving resources. The Zombie Mode Menu isn’t about achieving massive wins; it’s about finding small, manageable ways to gently nudge yourself forward.

The tasks in this menu are intentionally light, low-pressure, and designed to minimize decision fatigue. You’re not here to conquer the world—you’re here to take one tiny step at a time and honor your current capacity.

### 🥄 **Appetizers (5 min)**
When your energy is at its lowest, the goal is to create small ripples of progress without overwhelm.

- **Quick wins:** Simple, satisfying tasks like putting away one item, replying to a short message, or marking an email as read.
- **Simple sorting:** Reduce visual clutter by tidying one small surface or grouping similar items.
- **Basic admin:** Cross off a micro-task like adding a reminder or updating a calendar entry.
- **Gentle physical movement:** Stand, stretch, or shift spaces to lightly engage your body.

### 🍲 **Main Courses (15-30 min)**
When energy permits, gently move into slightly longer tasks:
- Focus on repetitive, predictable tasks.
- Tackle routine activities that require minimal decision-making.
- Handle maintenance tasks that have clear end-points.

### 🍰 **Desserts (Rewards)**
- Comfort-focused activities (e.g., a favorite playlist).
- Progress markers (e.g., ticking off a box).
- Small moments of self-acknowledgment.

The key here is gentleness and compassion. Even the smallest action is progress, and every completed task is a step toward rebuilding momentum.
