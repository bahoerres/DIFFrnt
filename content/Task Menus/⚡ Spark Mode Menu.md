Spark Mode is like catching glimpses of sunlight breaking through clouds. Your energy is present but inconsistent, and your focus can waver if not anchored carefully. Tasks in this mode thrive on flexibility and gentle momentum building. Think of it as a bridge between the slower pace of Zombie Mode and the intense focus of Hyperfocus Mode.

This menu is about capturing those fleeting moments of clarity and directing them into meaningful progress without overwhelming yourself. It's an ideal state for setting up future tasks, exploring ideas, or completing mid-level focus work.
