## Recommended Next Steps
1. Complete partial notes
2. Standardize note naming
3. Create Getting Started Guide
4. Develop Setup Guide
5. Add External Resources

Would you like me to:
1. Start completing any of the partial notes?
2. Create standardized naming conventions?
3. Begin work on Phase 2 items?
4. Develop any of the planned resources?

This audit reveals we've built a solid core system but have some gaps in support documentation and external resources. The main structural elements are in place, but we could improve consistency and completeness.
