## The Unexpected Alliance of Stoicism and Neurodiversity

In the midst of career transition and personal growth, I've found an unexpected ally: ancient Stoic philosophy. As I navigate the complexities of ADHD, suspected autism, and a pivot from culinary arts to technology, the teachings of Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca have become a grounding force. Today, I want to share how these timeless principles are helping me tackle modern challenges.

## The Dichotomy of Control: A Neurodivergent Perspective

Epictetus taught that some things are within our control, while others are not. For those of us with neurodivergent minds, this principle is liberating. We can't change our brain wiring, but we can change how we respond to it.

Recently, I struggled with focus during a particularly dense networking course. Instead of berating myself (a habit I'm slowly unlearning), I remembered Epictetus' words. I can't control how my brain processes information, but I can control my learning environment. I broke the material into smaller chunks, incorporated visual aids, and scheduled regular breaks. The result? Improved comprehension and less frustration.

> **Practical tip:** Identify one aspect of your neurodivergence that you often fight against. How can you adapt your environment or approach to work with this trait rather than against it?

### Amor Fati: Loving Your Fate, Neurodiversity and All

The Stoic concept of *"amor fati"* - loving your fate - has been transformative in my journey of self-acceptance. It's not about passive resignation but active embrace of our circumstances.

I'll be honest: there are days when I resent the challenges that come with ADHD. But when I reframe these traits as unique features rather than bugs, everything shifts. My ability to hyperfocus, for instance, has allowed me to dive deep into complex security protocols in ways my neurotypical peers might find exhausting.

> **Reflection question:** What aspects of your neurodivergence have unexpectedly served you well in your life or career?

### Memento Mori: Embracing Impermanence in Career and Recovery

The Stoic reminder of our mortality - *memento mori* - might seem morbid, but it's been a powerful motivator in my sobriety and career transition. Remembering that our time is finite adds urgency to our pursuits and helps put setbacks into perspective.

Last week, I bombed a practice certification exam. In the past, this might have sent me into a spiral of self-doubt. Instead, I reminded myself that this temporary setback is just a small blip in my larger journey. It renewed my determination to study and try again.

> **Challenge:** Next time you face a setback, big or small, try asking yourself: "Will this matter in a year? In five years?" Use this perspective to guide your response.

## ## Practicing Virtues: The Stoic Path to Personal Growth

The Stoics emphasized four cardinal virtues: wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance. As I've grappled with these concepts, I've found they offer a framework for personal growth that's particularly relevant to neurodivergent individuals in transition.

- **Wisdom:** Continually learning about my neurodivergence and how it impacts my life and work.
- **Justice:** Advocating for myself and others in the neurodivergent community.
- **Courage:** Facing the uncertainties of a career change and the ongoing challenge of sobriety.
- **Temperance:** Balancing my enthusiasm for new projects with the need for rest and self-care.

I'm far from perfect in embodying these virtues, but they provide a north star for my efforts.

> **Self-reflection exercise:** Which of these virtues do you find most challenging? How might focusing on it improve your current situation?


## The View from Above: Gaining Perspective on Our Journeys

Marcus Aurelius encouraged taking the "view from above" - imagining our lives from a cosmic perspective. This practice has been invaluable in managing the anxiety that often comes with ADHD and major life changes.

When I'm overwhelmed by the details of a networking concept or anxious about my career shift, I try to zoom out. In the grand scheme of things, my journey is unique and valuable, regardless of its pace or direction.

> **Mindfulness practice:** Next time you're feeling stuck or anxious, try this visualization. Imagine yourself rising above your current situation, seeing it from increasingly distant perspectives. How does this change your view of your challenges?

## Conclusion: A Philosophy for the Neurodivergent Journey

Stoicism isn't a magic solution to the challenges of neurodivergence or life transitions. There are still days when focus eludes me, when the career path seems uncertain, or when sobriety feels like an uphill battle. But these ancient teachings provide a framework for resilience, self-acceptance, and growth that resonates deeply with our modern struggles.

As we continue to navigate our unique paths, let's remember that our neurodivergent minds, with all their challenges and gifts, are an integral part of the human tapestry. In embracing them, we not only improve our own lives but enrich the world around us.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. How do you find strength in your neurodivergence? What philosophies or practices have helped you navigate life's transitions?
