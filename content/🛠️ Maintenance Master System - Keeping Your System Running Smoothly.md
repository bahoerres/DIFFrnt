A well-maintained system is more likely to support you when you need it most! This section will guide you in creating a personalized maintenance plan that incorporates key principles from Getting Things Done (GTD) within the framework of your executive function support system.

### Daily System Hygiene: Small Steps, Big Impact

- **Morning Reset (Capture and Prepare):**
    - Check Current Energy State ([[üîã Energy States - Understanding Your Brain's Power Management System]]): Start your day by acknowledging your energy level. This will guide your task selection and help you choose the appropriate Task Menu ([[üçΩÔ∏è Task Menus]]) for the day.
    - Refresh Quick Wins List ([[‚úÖ Quick Wins List - Your Momentum-Building Toolkit]]): Have a few easy, low-barrier tasks readily available to build momentum and create a sense of accomplishment early on.
    - Stage critical tools: Gather and arrange the tools and resources you'll likely need for the day, minimizing friction and making it easier to transition between tasks.
    - Clear capture points: Ensure your physical and digital inboxes are empty and ready to collect any new tasks, ideas, or information that arise throughout the day.
- **Evening Cleanup (Clarify and Organize):**
    - Process quick capture notes: Take a few minutes to review everything you captured throughout the day. Use the GTD "2-minute rule" to complete any quick tasks immediately.
    - Update task statuses: Review your task lists and update the status of any items you worked on. Move completed tasks to "done," reschedule anything that needs to be moved, and add any new tasks that have come up.
    - Stage tomorrow's tools: Prepare your workspace for the next day by setting out the tools and resources you'll need for your planned tasks, making the morning routine smoother.
    - Clear work surfaces: Take a few minutes to tidy your physical and digital workspaces, creating a sense of closure and setting the stage for a fresh start tomorrow.
    - Reset support systems: Check that your support tools (timers, fidgets, noise-canceling headphones, etc.) are ready to go for the next day.

### Weekly System Care: The GTD Weekly Review

- **Review and Reflect:**
    - Process all inboxes to zero: Ensure all your capture points (physical inboxes, note-taking apps, email, etc.) are completely empty.
    - Review upcoming calendar events: Look ahead at your schedule for the upcoming week, noting any appointments, deadlines, or events that need attention or preparation.
    - Update project lists and next actions: Go through your project lists, making sure next actions are clearly defined and any new tasks are added.
    - Celebrate accomplishments: Take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate what you've achieved during the week.

### Monthly System Audit: Deep Dive and Optimization

- **Analyze and Adjust:**
    - Review Energy States and Task Menu Effectiveness: Look back at your energy levels over the past month and see how well you were able to match tasks to your capacity.
    - Identify areas for improvement: Based on your review, consider what's working well and what could be improved in your system. Are there any recurring challenges or roadblocks? Are there any areas where you need additional support?
    - Adjust the system based on your observations: Update your Task Menus, Quick Wins List, or other components of your system to better reflect your current needs and priorities.

### Personal Maintenance: You Are the System

- **Energy Management:**
    - Implement Recharge Protocols: Use the Recharge Protocols outlined in the sources, choosing the right level of recharge based on your current energy state.
    - Experiment and adjust: Find what recharges you most effectively and build those activities into your schedule.
- **Emotional Maintenance:**
    - Use the Daily Check-in Template: Regularly check in with your emotional state using a simple template.
    - Implement Burnout Prevention Strategies: Be proactive in preventing burnout by recognizing early warning signs and using the intervention protocols outlined in the sources.

**Remember:** This is your system! It's meant to support you, not the other way around. Experiment, adjust, and make it your own. The key is to find what works for you and be consistent in implementing it. You've got this!
