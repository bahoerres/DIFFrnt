```markdown
CATCH THE SPARK:
1. DON'T PREP MORE - START NOW
2. Set timer for 10 minutes
3. Pick ONE thing only
4. Give yourself points
5. Record what worked

WHEN STUCK:
- Change one constraint
- Move to a different spot
- Pick a smaller chunk
- Add novelty/game element

MAINTAIN MOMENTUM:
- Keep timer visible
- Stack small wins
- Note energy level
- Prep next task while motivated
