## 






Would you like me to:
1. Create specific cards for different environments (home/work/public)?
2. Add more detailed transition protocols for specific scenarios?
3. Develop emergency cards for common crisis points?
4. Create a card organization system?

These cards are designed to be quickly scannable when you're in any state, with clear, actionable steps rather than theory or explanation. They're particularly focused on the "do this now" aspect rather than the "why" to make them useful in the moment.
