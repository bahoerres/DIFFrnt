### Key Changes Made:
1. Removed SLDL from Friday, replaced with Good Mornings
   - Different hip hinge pattern
   - Less overlap with Tuesday deadlifts
   - Still hits posterior chain

2. Face pulls appear twice but:
   - Monday: More shoulder health focus
   - Thursday: More upper back focus
   - Different angles/intentions

3. Rowing Progression:
   - Tuesday: Heavier, basic pattern
   - Thursday: More variety, detail work

### Movement Pattern Distribution:
- Horizontal Push: 2x/week (different angles)
- Vertical Pull: 1x/week
- Horizontal Pull: Multiple angles, split between days
- Hip Hinge: 2x/week (Deadlift + Good Morning)
- Squat Pattern: 1x/week + single leg work
- Shoulder Isolation: Strategic placement for recovery

### Recovery Considerations:
- Main hip hinge work separated by 2 days
- Upper back work builds across week
- Face pulls support recovery
- Volume reduces on movement patterns as week progresseslab
