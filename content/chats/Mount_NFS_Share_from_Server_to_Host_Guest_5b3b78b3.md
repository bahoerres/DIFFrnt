walk me through adding an nfs share on server 192.168.0.25 at /mnt/purgatory/Media to /Media on the host/guest including persistence with fstab to mount at startup

 Certainly, I can walk you through the process of adding an NFS share from the server to your host/guest system, including making it persistent with fstab. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Ensure NFS client is installed on the host/guest system:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nfs-common
   ```

2. Create the mount point on the host/guest system:
   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /Media
   ```

3. Test the NFS share by mounting it manually:
   ```
   sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.25:/mnt/purgatory/Media /Media
   ```

4. If the mount is successful, you can unmount it:
   ```
   sudo umount /Media
   ```

5. Open the fstab file for editing:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

6. Add the following line to the fstab file:
   ```
   192.168.0.25:/mnt/purgatory/Media /Media nfs defaults 0 0
   ```

7. Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

8. Test the fstab entry:
   ```
   sudo mount -a
   ```

9. Verify the mount:
   ```
   df -h
   ```

10. Reboot your system to ensure it mounts automatically on startup:
    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```

After the reboot, the NFS share should be automatically mounted at /Media.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?

simply having the entry in /etc/fstab is enough?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 02:44:35 UTC

 You're right to double-check. While having the entry in /etc/fstab is necessary for automatic mounting at startup, it's not always sufficient on its own. Let me clarify:

1. The entry in /etc/fstab is indeed crucial for mounting the NFS share automatically at boot time.

2. However, some additional considerations are important:

   a. Network availability: The NFS server needs to be accessible when the system boots. If the network isn't ready when the mount attempt occurs, it might fail.

   b. Boot order: The network service needs to be started before the mount attempt.

   c. Timeout settings: Sometimes, the mount attempt might time out if the server is slow to respond.

To address these potential issues, you can modify the fstab entry to make it more robust:

```
192.168.0.25:/mnt/purgatory/Media /Media nfs defaults,_netdev,timeo=900,retrans=5,soft 0 0
```

Here's what these options do:

- `_netdev`: Tells the system this is a network mount and should wait for the network to be available.
- `timeo=900`: Sets the timeout to 90 seconds (900 deciseconds).
- `retrans=5`: Number of retries before giving up.
- `soft`: Allows the system to continue booting if the mount fails, rather than hanging.

Additionally, you might want to consider using `autofs` for more flexible and robust network mounts, especially if the NFS server isn't always available.

Would you like more information on any of these points or on setting up autofs?

wanna help me troubleshoot dns too? it's specific to this VM. i can ping 1.1.1.1 but google.com kicks an unable to resolve error

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 02:46:38 UTC

 Certainly, I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the DNS issue on your VM. Since you can ping 1.1.1.1 but can't resolve domain names, it's likely a DNS configuration problem. Let's go through some steps to diagnose and potentially fix the issue:

1. First, let's check your current DNS configuration:
   ```
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   This file should contain nameserver entries. What does it show?

2. Try to manually resolve a domain:
   ```
   nslookup google.com
   ```
   or
   ```
   dig google.com
   ```
   What output do you get?

3. Check if you can reach a DNS server:
   ```
   ping 8.8.8.8
   ```
   Does this work?

4. If the above steps don't reveal the issue, let's check your network configuration:
   ```
   ip addr show
   ```
   Make sure your network interface has the correct IP address.

5. Check your default gateway:
   ```
   ip route show
   ```
   Ensure there's a default route present.

6. If you're using DHCP, try to renew your IP address:
   ```
   sudo dhclient -v
   ```

7. If you're using a static IP, check your /etc/network/interfaces file (or equivalent, depending on your distro) to ensure DNS servers are correctly specified.

8. You might also want to check if systemd-resolved is running and configured correctly:
   ```
   systemctl status systemd-resolved
   ```

Can you try these steps and let me know what you find? Particularly, I'm interested in what your /etc/resolv.conf file contains and what output you get from the nslookup or dig commands.

so the container i was having trouble with only had a resolv.conf containing:

search: bh-lab.live
nameserver: 192.168.0.254 

that's the ip of my router, i copied from a working container on another subnet to include: 

domain: bh-lab.live
search: bh-lab.live
nameserver: 10.10.30.1

using the interface address assigned to the vlan that this container is on. 

walk me through what i did and why it works now.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 03:20:03 UTC

 Certainly! Let's break down what happened and why the change you made resolved the issue:

1. Original configuration:
   Your container had a resolv.conf with:
   ```
   search bh-lab.live
   nameserver 192.168.0.254
   ```

   This configuration was trying to use your router (192.168.0.254) as the DNS server. However, it seems that your router either wasn't configured to handle DNS requests or wasn't reachable from the container's network.

2. New configuration:
   You added:
   ```
   domain bh-lab.live
   search bh-lab.live
   nameserver 10.10.30.1
   ```

Here's why this works now:

1. Domain and Search: 
   - The "domain" line sets the default domain for the system. 
   - The "search" line allows the system to append this domain to unqualified hostnames.
   - Both being set to "bh-lab.live" ensures consistency in your local domain naming.

2. Nameserver:
   - You changed the nameserver from 192.168.0.254 (router) to 10.10.30.1.
   - This new IP (10.10.30.1) is on the VLAN that the container is using.
   - It's likely that this IP belongs to a DNS server that's actually reachable from the container's network and is configured to handle DNS requests.

3. Network topology:
   - Your comment about "using the interface address assigned to the VLAN that this container is on" suggests that the container is in a different network segment than your router.
   - The new nameserver (10.10.30.1) is probably a local DNS server or a gateway for that VLAN that can properly route DNS requests.

4. Why it works:
   - The container can now reach the DNS server (10.10.30.1) on its local network.
   - This DNS server is properly configured to resolve both internal and external domain names.
   - The "domain" and "search" directives help with resolving local hostnames in your bh-lab.live domain.

In essence, you've pointed the container to a DNS server that it can actually reach and that's configured to handle its requests, rather than trying to use a router that might not be accessible or properly configured for DNS from that network segment.

This solution aligns the container's DNS configuration with the network it's actually on, ensuring it can resolve both internal and external domain names correctly.

would one or the other change have had the same impact? or are all three components required to function correctly?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 03:21:42 UTC

 Great question! Let's break this down to understand the impact of each component:

1. Nameserver change:
   This is the most critical change you made. Changing the nameserver from 192.168.0.254 to 10.10.30.1 is likely the primary reason why DNS resolution now works. This points the container to a DNS server it can actually reach and that's configured to handle its requests.

2. Domain directive:
   Adding the "domain bh-lab.live" line is not strictly necessary for basic DNS resolution of external domains like google.com. It's more useful for internal hostname resolution within your bh-lab.live domain.

3. Search directive:
   The "search bh-lab.live" line was already present in your original configuration, so this didn't change.

To directly answer your question:

- The nameserver change alone would likely have been sufficient to resolve the immediate issue of being unable to resolve external domains like google.com.

- The domain and search directives are more important for local domain name resolution and convenience, but aren't strictly required for basic external DNS resolution.

So, in summary:

- For basic external DNS resolution: Only the nameserver change was required.
- For optimal functionality, especially with internal hostnames: All three components are beneficial.

If you want to test this, you could try removing the "domain" line and see if external DNS resolution still works. It likely will, but you might notice differences when trying to resolve internal hostnames in your bh-lab.live domain.

Remember, the exact behavior can sometimes depend on the specific DNS server configuration and network setup, but generally, the nameserver change is the most crucial element for the problem you were experiencing.
