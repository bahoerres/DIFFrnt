great. if i manually set the ip addresses for my proxmox servers on the server itself, and i were to also set static reservations on my virtualized opnsense instance that i use as the main firewall/router for my home networks... 

would that cause problems?

 Setting static IP addresses on your Proxmox servers and creating static reservations for those IP addresses on your virtualized OPNsense instance should not cause any problems, as long as the configuration is done correctly.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. IP Address Consistency: Ensure that the static IP addresses you set on the Proxmox servers match the IP addresses you reserve in the OPNsense DHCP server. This consistency will prevent any conflicts or confusion in the network.

2. Subnet and Network Configuration: Make sure that the static IP addresses you assign to the Proxmox servers belong to the same subnet and network as the OPNsense instance. The subnet mask and default gateway should be correctly configured on both the Proxmox servers and the OPNsense instance.

3. DHCP Range: If you have other devices on the network that rely on DHCP for IP address assignment, ensure that the static IP addresses you set for the Proxmox servers are outside the DHCP range configured on the OPNsense instance. This will prevent the OPNsense DHCP server from accidentally assigning the same IP address to another device.

4. Firewall Rules: If you have any firewall rules or network policies configured on the OPNsense instance, make sure they allow the necessary traffic to and from the Proxmox servers based on their static IP addresses.

As long as you follow these guidelines and ensure proper configuration on both the Proxmox servers and the OPNsense instance, setting static IP addresses on the servers and creating corresponding static reservations on the OPNsense should not cause any problems. This setup can provide a stable and predictable network configuration for your Proxmox servers.
