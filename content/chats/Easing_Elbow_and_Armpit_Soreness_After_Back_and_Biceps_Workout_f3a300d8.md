 Given your understanding of anatomy and physiology, your assessment that this is likely related to tight muscles or tendons is reasonable. Here are some suggestions that might help ease your soreness and tightness:

1. Active Recovery: Light, low-impact exercises like walking or swimming can increase blood flow to the affected areas, potentially speeding up recovery.

2. Dynamic Stretching: Gentle, controlled movements through your range of motion can help improve flexibility and reduce tightness.

3. Self-Myofascial Release: Using a foam roller or massage ball on your back, biceps, and around the armpit area can help release tension in the muscles and fascia.

4. Contrast Therapy: Alternating between heat and cold treatments can help reduce inflammation and promote blood flow. Apply heat for about 15-20 minutes, then cold for 10-15 minutes.

5. Hydration: Ensure you're drinking plenty of water, as proper hydration can aid in muscle recovery and reduce soreness.

6. Topical Treatments: Anti-inflammatory creams or gels containing ingredients like arnica or menthol might provide some relief.

7. Gentle Mobility Exercises: Focus on shoulder and elbow mobility exercises to maintain range of motion without overstressing the affected areas.

8. Proper Sleep: Ensure you're getting enough quality sleep, as this is when much of the body's repair processes occur.

If the pain persists or worsens, it would be wise to consult with a physiotherapist or sports medicine professional. They can provide a more tailored approach based on a thorough assessment of your condition.

i did my back and biceps workout at the gym yesterday and today i'm pretty tight and spicy in the elbows and armpits. 

i have enough of an understanding of anatomy and physiology that i suspect this is a tendon thing, or just muscles being tight and irritating the insertion points. 

anything outside of the ordinary that i might be able to do to help myself loosen back up and ease a bit of the soreness?

something else i was curious about: 

occasionally when i first get to the gym and i'm doing my lighter warm-up/priming type movements i can get real shaky. i'm not exerting enough effort to be experiencing muscle failure. 

i'm making up in my head that this is more of a CNS fatigue type thing, if i'm not all the way awake, or if i'm just generally kind of fried from any number of other factors. 

am i on the right track?

 You're on the right track with your thinking. The shakiness you're experiencing during warm-up exercises, especially when it's not due to muscle fatigue, can indeed be related to factors affecting your central nervous system (CNS). Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. CNS Fatigue: As you suggested, this could be a sign of CNS fatigue. Your nervous system plays a crucial role in muscle activation and coordination. If it's not fully recovered or is overworked, you might experience shakiness even with light loads.

2. Sleep and Recovery: Lack of quality sleep or incomplete recovery from previous workouts can impact your CNS, leading to this type of tremor.

3. Stress and Mental Fatigue: High stress levels or mental exhaustion can affect your nervous system's ability to smoothly activate muscles.

4. Caffeine or Stimulants: If you've recently consumed caffeine or other stimulants, this could contribute to shakiness, especially if you're sensitive to these substances.

5. Blood Sugar Levels: Low blood sugar can sometimes cause tremors or shakiness, which might be more noticeable during light exercise.

6. Dehydration: Being insufficiently hydrated can affect nerve function and muscle control.

7. Neuromuscular Efficiency: If you're just starting a workout routine or returning after a break, your nervous system might need time to adapt to efficiently recruiting muscle fibers.

8. Temperature: If your body or the gym is cold, this can sometimes lead to shaking until you're properly warmed up.

To address this, you might try:
- Ensuring adequate sleep and recovery time between workouts
- Managing stress levels
- Staying well-hydrated
- Having a small, balanced snack before your workout
- Gradually warming up to "wake up" your nervous system
- Practicing deep breathing or relaxation techniques before your workout

If the shakiness persists or worsens, it might be worth consulting with a sports medicine professional or your doctor to rule out any underlying issues.
