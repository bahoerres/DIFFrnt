I'm pretty sure in sway there was an action to change focus between floating and non floating groups and it would bring whichever group was focused to the front. 

What would my equivalent look like in hyprland?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 22:57:53 UTC

 In Hyprland, you can achieve similar functionality to what you're describing in Sway. While Hyprland doesn't have an exact one-to-one equivalent, you can set up keybindings to switch focus between floating and tiled windows. Here's how you might set this up:

1. To focus the next floating window:
```
bind = $mainMod, SOME_KEY, focuscurrentorlast, floating
```

2. To focus the last focused tiled window:
```
bind = $mainMod, ANOTHER_KEY, focuscurrentorlast, 
```

These bindings will allow you to switch focus between floating and tiled windows. The `focuscurrentorlast` dispatcher will focus the most recently focused window of the specified type (floating or tiled).

To bring the focused group to the front, Hyprland automatically does this when you focus a window. Floating windows, when focused, will be brought to the front of other floating windows.

If you want more granular control, you can also use the `bringactivetotop` dispatcher to explicitly bring the active window to the top:

```
bind = $mainMod, SOME_OTHER_KEY, bringactivetotop
```

You would need to replace `SOME_KEY`, `ANOTHER_KEY`, and `SOME_OTHER_KEY` with the actual keys you want to use for these actions.

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:01:10 UTC

I think bringactivetotop is being deprecated. Something about z positions or layers replacing it I think. 

This is ultimately what I want. Tiled windows brought to front as if a tiling window is focused, then switching back to floating as a toggle. Ah, a toggle to focus and being to front floating or non floating windows (all of a certain type)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:01:10 UTC

 You're right, and I apologize for the outdated information. Let's create a more up-to-date solution for what you're looking for. In Hyprland, we can use layers and focus switching to achieve the toggle effect you want between floating and tiled windows.

Here's a custom solution using Hyprland's scripting capabilities:

<antThinking>This script is substantial, self-contained, and likely to be modified or reused. It's a good candidate for an artifact. As it's a new piece of code, I'll create a new artifact for it.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-float-tile-toggle" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Hyprland Float/Tile Toggle Script">
#!/bin/bash

# Get the currently focused window
current_window=$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r '.address')

# Check if the current window is floating
is_floating=$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r '.floating')

if [ "$is_floating" = "true" ]; then
    # If current window is floating, focus the last tiled window
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == false) | .address' | tail -n1)"
else
    # If current window is tiled, focus the last floating window
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true) | .address' | tail -n1)"
fi

# Bring the newly focused window to the front
hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "special:minimized"
hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "e+0"
</antArtifact>

This script does the following:

1. It gets the currently focused window.
2. It checks if the current window is floating.
3. If the current window is floating, it focuses the last tiled window.
4. If the current window is tiled, it focuses the last floating window.
5. Finally, it brings the newly focused window to the front by moving it to a special workspace and then back to the current workspace. This effectively raises its z-index without using the deprecated `bringactivetotop` command.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, for example, `~/.config/hypr/float-tile-toggle.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/float-tile-toggle.sh`
3. Add a keybinding to your Hyprland config:

```
bind = $mainMod, SOME_KEY, exec, ~/.config/hypr/float-tile-toggle.sh
```

Replace `SOME_KEY` with the key you want to use for this toggle.

This solution provides a toggle that will switch focus between floating and tiled windows, bringing the newly focused window to the front each time. It should work with the current Hyprland functionality and avoid using deprecated commands.

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail or help you customize it further?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:02:37 UTC

Is it the magic workspace? I'm currently on my phone so side scrolling to read the text is kinda meh.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:02:37 UTC

 I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the side-scrolling. You're right to ask about the special workspace - I used "special:minimized" in the script, which isn't quite correct. Let me provide a more concise and correct version of the script:

<antThinking>This is an update to the existing script artifact. I'll use the same identifier to show the evolution of our code.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-float-tile-toggle" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated Hyprland Float/Tile Toggle Script">
#!/bin/bash

current=$(hyprctl activewindow -j)
is_floating=$(echo "$current" | jq -r '.floating')

if [ "$is_floating" = "true" ]; then
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == false) | .address' | tail -n1)"
else
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true) | .address' | tail -n1)"
fi

# Bring to front using the magic workspace
hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "special"
hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace e+0
</antArtifact>

You're absolutely correct - it is indeed the "magic" workspace in Hyprland. In this updated version, I've made these changes:

1. Simplified the script to make it more readable.
2. Used `"special"` instead of `"special:minimized"` for the magic workspace.

The magic workspace in Hyprland is a special workspace that can be used for various purposes, including temporarily moving windows to change their z-order (bring them to front).

The last two lines of the script do the following:
1. Move the window to the special workspace: `hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "special"`
2. Immediately move it back to the current workspace: `hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace e+0`

This quick move to the special workspace and back effectively brings the window to the front of its layer (floating or tiled).

Is this clearer and easier to understand? Let me know if you need any further explanations or modifications to the script.

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:04:03 UTC

Oh, minimized would probably work too. Like, minimize all floating windows in order to expose/bring to front tiled windows, to switch back, restore floating windows.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:04:03 UTC

 That's a great idea! We can modify the script to use minimization as a way to toggle between floating and tiled windows. This approach can be more visually clear for users. Let's update the script to implement this strategy:

<antThinking>We're evolving our script based on the user's suggestion. This is a significant change to the existing artifact, so I'll update it with the new approach.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-float-tile-toggle" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Hyprland Float/Tile Toggle Script with Minimization">
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check if any floating window is visible
any_floating_visible() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -e '.[] | select(.floating == true and .hidden == false)' > /dev/null
}

# Function to minimize all floating windows
minimize_floating() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true) | .address' | while read -r window; do
        hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "special:minimized,address:$window"
    done
}

# Function to restore all minimized floating windows
restore_floating() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true and .workspace.name == "special:minimized") | .address' | while read -r window; do
        hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "e+0,address:$window"
    done
}

# Main toggle logic
if any_floating_visible; then
    minimize_floating
    # Focus the last tiled window
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == false) | .address' | tail -n1)"
else
    restore_floating
    # Focus the last floating window
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true) | .address' | tail -n1)"
fi
</antArtifact>

This updated script does the following:

1. It defines a function `any_floating_visible()` to check if any floating window is currently visible.

2. The `minimize_floating()` function moves all floating windows to the `special:minimized` workspace, effectively hiding them.

3. The `restore_floating()` function brings back all minimized floating windows to the current workspace.

4. The main logic checks if any floating windows are visible:
   - If yes, it minimizes all floating windows and focuses the last tiled window.
   - If no, it restores all minimized floating windows and focuses the last floating window.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `~/.config/hypr/float-tile-toggle.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/float-tile-toggle.sh`
3. Add a keybinding to your Hyprland config:

```
bind = $mainMod, SOME_KEY, exec, ~/.config/hypr/float-tile-toggle.sh
```

Replace `SOME_KEY` with your preferred key.

This approach provides a clear visual toggle between floating and tiled windows. When you activate it, you'll either see all your tiled windows with floating ones hidden, or all your windows including the floating ones.

Would you like me to explain any part of this script further or help you adapt it to your specific needs?

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:06:08 UTC

 The issue you're experiencing with seemingly "sticky" mod keys can be frustrating. While the passthrough bind toggle is different, as you noted, there are a few approaches we can take to address potential sticky key behavior in Hyprland. Let's explore some solutions:

1. Input Configuration:
First, we can try adjusting the input settings in your Hyprland configuration. Add or modify the following in your hyprland.conf:

<antThinking>This configuration snippet is relatively short and part of a larger explanation, so it doesn't warrant a separate artifact. We'll keep it inline for better readability in the conversation context.</antThinking>

```
input {
    kb_layout = us
    kb_variant =
    kb_model =
    kb_options =
    kb_rules =

    follow_mouse = 1
    repeat_rate = 25
    repeat_delay = 600

    sensitivity = 0 # -1.0 - 1.0, 0 means no modification.
    accel_profile = flat
}
```

The `repeat_rate` and `repeat_delay` settings can help with key responsiveness. Adjust these values to find what works best for you.

2. Xkb Options:
You can try adding some xkb options to potentially mitigate sticky key behavior:

```
input {
    kb_options = ctrl:nocaps,altwin:swap_lalt_lwin
}
```

This example disables Caps Lock and swaps the left Alt and Win keys. You can customize these options based on your preferences.

3. Compositor Reload:
Sometimes, issues can be resolved by reloading the compositor. Add a keybind to reload Hyprland:

```
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, R, exec, hyprctl reload
```

4. Key Event Debugging:
To understand what's happening with your key events, you can use `evtest`. Install it (`sudo pacman -S evtest` on Arch-based systems) and run:

```
evtest
```

This will show you raw input events, which can help identify if it's a hardware or software issue.

5. Hyprland Debug Mode:
Run Hyprland in debug mode to see if there are any relevant messages:

```
Hyprland -d
```

6. Systemd User Service:
If the issue persists across reboots, consider creating a systemd user service to reset input devices on login:

<antThinking>This systemd service file is a standalone configuration that users might want to modify or reference later. It's a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-input-reset" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="ini" title="Hyprland Input Reset Service">
[Unit]
Description=Reset input devices for Hyprland
After=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c 'sleep 2 && hyprctl keyword input:kb_layout "us,us"'
Type=oneshot

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
</antArtifact>

Save this as `~/.config/systemd/user/hyprland-input-reset.service`, then enable and start it:

```
systemctl --user enable hyprland-input-reset.service
systemctl --user start hyprland-input-reset.service
```

7. Hardware Check:
If none of the software solutions work, consider testing your keyboard on a different system or with a different compositor to rule out hardware issues.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or help you implement a specific solution?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:06:08 UTC

Is there a way to ensure my keys (specifically the mod keys) don't exhibit any sort of sticky behavior? I feel like they're randomly getting stuck and it's really not fun. I know there's a passthrough bind toggle in my config, but this seems different.

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:07:01 UTC

Would this also be where I would disable the track pad while typing for palm rejection?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:07:01 UTC

 Yes, absolutely! Disabling the trackpad while typing (often called palm rejection or palm detection) can indeed be configured in the same input section of your Hyprland configuration. This is a great feature to prevent accidental cursor movements or clicks while you're typing.

Let's update the input configuration to include this setting:

<antThinking>This is an extension of the earlier input configuration. While it's not a completely new artifact, it's substantial enough and likely to be reused, so it warrants an artifact update.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-input-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprland Input Configuration with Palm Rejection">
input {
    kb_layout = us
    kb_variant =
    kb_model =
    kb_options =
    kb_rules =

    follow_mouse = 1
    repeat_rate = 25
    repeat_delay = 600

    sensitivity = 0 # -1.0 - 1.0, 0 means no modification.
    accel_profile = flat

    touchpad {
        natural_scroll = true
        disable_while_typing = true
        clickfinger_behavior = true
        middle_button_emulation = true
        tap-to-click = true
    }
}
</antArtifact>

In this updated configuration:

1. We've added a `touchpad` section within the `input` block.
2. The key setting for palm rejection is `disable_while_typing = true`. This will disable the touchpad momentarily when the system detects keyboard input.

Other touchpad settings included here are:
- `natural_scroll = true`: Enables "natural" (reversed) scrolling direction.
- `clickfinger_behavior = true`: Enables click behavior similar to macOS (one finger for left click, two for right click, etc.).
- `middle_button_emulation = true`: Allows middle-click emulation.
- `tap-to-click = true`: Enables tapping the touchpad to click.

You can adjust these additional settings based on your preferences. If you only want palm rejection, you can remove the other lines and keep just the `disable_while_typing = true` line.

To apply these changes:

1. Add this configuration to your `hyprland.conf` file (usually located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`).
2. Save the file.
3. Either restart Hyprland or reload the configuration (if you have a reload keybind set up).

Remember, the exact behavior and effectiveness of palm rejection can vary depending on your hardware and drivers. You might need to fine-tune the settings or explore additional software solutions if you find this built-in method insufficient for your needs.

Would you like me to explain any of these settings further or help you with any other touchpad-related configurations?

 Certainly! I'll merge your existing configuration with the additional settings we discussed. Here's the combined and optimized version:

<antThinking>This is a significant update to the existing input configuration. We'll use the same artifact identifier to show the evolution of the configuration, incorporating the user's existing settings.</antThinking>

    }
}

gestures {
    workspace_swipe = true
}
</antArtifact>

Here's what I've done in this merged configuration:

1. Kept your existing keyboard layout settings.
2. Retained your `numlock_by_default` and `mouse_refocus` settings.
3. Kept the commented-out international layout options for reference.
4. Added the `repeat_rate` and `repeat_delay` settings we discussed earlier for potential sticky key mitigation.
5. Merged the touchpad settings, keeping your existing options and adding `tap-to-click = true`.
6. Retained your `gestures` section with `workspace_swipe` enabled.

Notable changes and points to consider:

- I've kept `natural_scroll = true` as it was in your original config. If you're using this on a desktop, you might want to change it to `false`.
- `clickfinger_behavior` is set to `false` as per your original config. If you want to enable macOS-like click behavior, you can change this to `true`.
- I've added `tap-to-click = true`. If you prefer not to have this, you can remove this line or set it to `false`.
- The `sensitivity` setting is kept at 0, which means no modification to pointer speed.

To apply these changes:

1. Replace the corresponding section in your `hyprland.conf` file (usually at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`) with this new configuration.
2. Save the file.
3. Either restart Hyprland or reload the configuration if you have a reload keybind set up.

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust or explain in this configuration?

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:19:24 UTC

can you tell me more about follow mouse and mouse refocus?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:19:24 UTC

 Certainly! The `follow_mouse` and `mouse_refocus` settings in Hyprland control how window focus behaves in relation to mouse movement. Let's break down each of these settings:

1. `follow_mouse`:
This setting determines how window focus follows your mouse cursor. In Hyprland, it can have several values:

- `0`: Disables follow mouse. Windows won't be focused when the mouse hovers over them.
- `1`: Normal follow mouse. Windows will be focused when the mouse enters them, but not when the mouse enters a floating window.
- `2`: Always follow mouse. Windows will always be focused when the mouse enters them, including floating windows.
- `3`: Follow mouse with a short delay. Similar to `1`, but with a small delay to prevent accidental focus changes.

In your current configuration, it's set to `1`, which is a good balance for most users.

2. `mouse_refocus`:
This setting, which you have set to `false`, controls whether a window should be refocused if the mouse enters it while it's already focused.

- When `true`: If you move your mouse out of a focused window and then back in, it will "refocus" that window, potentially triggering focus events.
- When `false` (as in your config): Once a window is focused, moving the mouse in and out of it won't trigger additional focus events. This can be useful to prevent accidental activation of focus-related actions.

The interplay between these settings affects how your desktop environment feels:

- With `follow_mouse = 1` and `mouse_refocus = false` (your current setup):
  - Windows will be focused when you move your mouse over them (except floating windows).
  - Once a window is focused, moving the mouse in and out of it won't cause it to "refocus".
  - This setup is good for users who want easy focus switching with mouse movement, but don't want accidental refocusing when the mouse briefly leaves and re-enters a window.

- If you changed to `follow_mouse = 2`:
  - All windows, including floating ones, would be focused when the mouse enters them.
  - This can be more convenient for some workflows but might lead to accidental focus changes.

- If you set `mouse_refocus = true`:
  - It would allow windows to regain focus when the mouse re-enters them, which can be useful for certain applications that rely on focus events, but it might also lead to unintended focus changes.

Your current configuration (`follow_mouse = 1` and `mouse_refocus = false`) is a good balance that provides easy focus switching while preventing some accidental focus changes. However, you might want to experiment with different combinations to find what feels most natural for your workflow.

Would you like me to explain how to test different configurations or discuss any specific scenarios where these settings might impact your workflow?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:21:32 UTC

can floating in a sense be considered similar/the same as "always on top"? i'm starting to get that idea.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:21:32 UTC

 You're on the right track with that observation. While floating windows and "always on top" windows share some similarities, they're not exactly the same. Let me break this down for you:

Floating Windows:
1. Can be moved freely around the screen
2. Are not constrained by the tiling layout
3. Can overlap with other windows
4. Can be resized freely
5. Are typically managed by the window manager along with tiled windows

"Always on Top" Windows:
1. Remain above other windows in the z-order (stack)
2. Can be either floating or tiled
3. Will stay on top even when focus is switched to another window
4. This is usually a property that can be toggled for any window

The Similarity:
The reason you're getting the idea that floating windows are similar to "always on top" is because in many window managers, including Hyprland, floating windows are often drawn on top of tiled windows by default. This behavior makes them appear similar to "always on top" windows in many situations.

Key Differences:
1. Z-order: While floating windows are often above tiled windows, they can still be stacked among themselves. An "always on top" window will stay above everything, including other floating windows.
2. Persistence: Floating is about layout and positioning, while "always on top" is about persistent z-order regardless of focus.
3. Tiling compatibility: A tiled window can be set to "always on top" without making it floating.

In Hyprland:
Hyprland doesn't have a built-in "always on top" feature as of my last update. However, you can achieve similar behavior by:

1. Making a window float: `hyprctl dispatch togglefloating`
2. Raising it to the top: `hyprctl dispatch bringactivetotop`

To toggle a truly "always on top" behavior, you'd need to use an external tool or script that constantly raises the window.

<antThinking>A script to toggle "always on top" behavior in Hyprland could be useful for the user. It's substantial enough and likely to be reused, so it warrants an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-always-on-top" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Hyprland Always-on-Top Toggle Script">
#!/bin/bash

# Get the address of the focused window
WINDOW=$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r ".address")

# Check if the window is already in our "always on top" list
if grep -q "$WINDOW" /tmp/always_on_top_windows 2>/dev/null; then
    # Remove from always on top
    sed -i "/$WINDOW/d" /tmp/always_on_top_windows
    notify-send "Removed window from always on top"
else
    # Add to always on top
    echo "$WINDOW" >> /tmp/always_on_top_windows
    notify-send "Added window to always on top"
fi

# Function to raise windows
raise_windows() {
    while read -r window; do
        hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$window"
        hyprctl dispatch bringactivetotop
    done < /tmp/always_on_top_windows
}

# Raise windows initially
raise_windows

# Watch for window focus changes and raise "always on top" windows
socat -u UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/hypr/"$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE"/.socket2.sock - | while read -r line; do
    if [[ $line == "focusedmon"* ]]; then
        raise_windows
    fi
done
</antArtifact>

This script toggles an "always on top" behavior for windows in Hyprland. To use it:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `~/.config/hypr/always_on_top.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/always_on_top.sh`
3. Add a keybind to your Hyprland config:
   ```
   bind = $mainMod, T, exec, ~/.config/hypr/always_on_top.sh
   ```

This script demonstrates how you can extend Hyprland's functionality to bridge the gap between floating windows and true "always on top" behavior.

Would you like me to explain any part of this script or discuss how to further customize window behavior in Hyprland?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:23:15 UTC

is it that in hyprland tiling windows are incabale of being "on top" 

there seems to be friction around floating windows being displayed behind tiling windows.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:23:15 UTC

 You've made an astute observation about Hyprland's window management behavior. Let me clarify this for you:

1. Tiled Windows vs. Floating Windows in Hyprland:
In Hyprland, tiled windows and floating windows are indeed treated differently when it comes to z-order (the order in which windows are stacked on top of each other).

2. Tiled Windows:
- Tiled windows in Hyprland are typically managed as part of the tiling layout.
- They don't have an individual z-order in the same way floating windows do.
- Tiled windows are generally drawn "behind" floating windows.

3. Floating Windows:
- Floating windows in Hyprland have their own z-order.
- By default, they are drawn "on top" of tiled windows.
- They can be stacked in various orders among themselves.

4. The "On Top" Concept:
- In the context of Hyprland, being "on top" usually refers to the ordering among floating windows.
- Tiled windows don't participate in this "on top" behavior in the same way floating windows do.

5. The Friction You're Noticing:
The friction you're experiencing regarding floating windows being displayed behind tiling windows is not typical behavior in Hyprland. By default, floating windows should appear above tiled windows. If you're seeing floating windows behind tiled windows, it could be due to:

- A specific configuration in your `hyprland.conf`
- A plugin or script that's altering the default behavior
- A potential bug in your version of Hyprland

To address this, you could try:

1. Checking your Hyprland configuration for any custom layer rules.
2. Updating Hyprland to the latest version if you haven't recently.
3. Using the `hyprctl` command to manually bring windows to the front:
   ```
   hyprctl dispatch bringactivetotop
   ```

<antThinking>A script to toggle a window between tiled and floating states while ensuring it stays visible could be useful. This warrants a new artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-toggle-float-visible" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Hyprland Toggle Float and Ensure Visibility">
#!/bin/bash

# Toggle floating state
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating

# Get current window info
window_info=$(hyprctl activewindow -j)

# Check if the window is now floating
is_floating=$(echo "$window_info" | jq -r '.floating')

if [ "$is_floating" = "true" ]; then
    # If it's floating, ensure it's on top
    hyprctl dispatch bringactivetotop
else
    # If it's tiled, you might want to do something else here
    # For example, you could focus it to ensure it's visible
    window_address=$(echo "$window_info" | jq -r '.address')
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$window_address"
fi
</antArtifact>

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `~/.config/hypr/toggle_float_visible.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/toggle_float_visible.sh`
3. Add a keybind to your Hyprland config:
   ```
   bind = $mainMod, V, exec, ~/.config/hypr/toggle_float_visible.sh
   ```

This script toggles a window between tiled and floating states, and ensures that floating windows are brought to the top, addressing the friction you're experiencing.

If you're still seeing unexpected behavior after trying these suggestions, it might be worth diving deeper into your specific setup or reporting the issue to the Hyprland developers. Would you like me to help you troubleshoot further or explain any part of this in more detail?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:24:45 UTC

so this concept that we were working on to switch focus between floating and tiling would really be a toggle between floating and minimized and the focus switching to the tiling "layer"

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:24:45 UTC

 You've got it! Your understanding is spot-on. Let's refine our approach based on this insight. What we're really aiming for is a toggle that switches between two states:

1. Floating windows visible and focused
2. Floating windows minimized, with focus on the tiling "layer"

This is a more accurate representation of what we want to achieve. Let's create a script that implements this behavior:

<antThinking>This is a significant revision of our earlier concept, warranting a new artifact. We'll create a new script that better reflects the user's understanding and desired functionality.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-float-tile-layer-toggle" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Hyprland Float/Tile Layer Toggle Script">
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check if any floating window is visible
any_floating_visible() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -e '.[] | select(.floating == true and .hidden == false)' > /dev/null
}

# Function to minimize all floating windows
minimize_floating() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true) | .address' | while read -r window; do
        hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "special:minimized,address:$window"
    done
}

# Function to restore all minimized floating windows
restore_floating() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true and .workspace.name == "special:minimized") | .address' | while read -r window; do
        hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "e+0,address:$window"
    done
}

# Main toggle logic
if any_floating_visible; then
    # If floating windows are visible, minimize them and focus on a tiled window
    minimize_floating
    # Focus the last tiled window
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == false) | .address' | tail -n1)"
else
    # If no floating windows are visible, restore them and focus on a floating window
    restore_floating
    # Focus the last restored floating window
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true) | .address' | tail -n1)"
fi
</antArtifact>

This script does the following:

1. It checks if any floating windows are currently visible.
2. If floating windows are visible:
   - It minimizes all floating windows by moving them to a special minimized workspace.
   - It then focuses on the last tiled window, effectively switching to the tiling "layer".
3. If no floating windows are visible:
   - It restores all minimized floating windows by moving them back to the current workspace.
   - It then focuses on the last restored floating window.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `~/.config/hypr/float_tile_toggle.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/float_tile_toggle.sh`
3. Add a keybinding to your Hyprland config:

```
bind = $mainMod, F, exec, ~/.config/hypr/float_tile_toggle.sh
```

Replace `F` with your preferred key.

This toggle effectively switches between the floating window layer and the tiled window layer, which aligns with your understanding of Hyprland's window management behavior. When you activate it:

- If floating windows are visible, they'll all be minimized, and you'll see and focus on your tiled windows.
- If floating windows are minimized, they'll all be restored, and you'll see and focus on your floating windows.

This approach respects the layer distinction in Hyprland between floating and tiled windows, providing a clean way to switch focus between these two modes of window management.

Would you like me to explain any part of this script further or help you integrate it into your Hyprland setup?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:33:58 UTC

they go away, but they don't come back.. is there something special i need to do in order for it to actually work as a toggle?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:33:58 UTC

 I apologize for the oversight. You're right; there might be an issue with the restoration part of the script. Let's debug and fix this. The problem likely lies in how Hyprland handles the special minimized workspace. Let's modify the script to ensure it works as a proper toggle:

<antThinking>We need to update our existing artifact to fix the toggle functionality. This is a significant change to address the user's issue.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-float-tile-layer-toggle" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated Hyprland Float/Tile Layer Toggle Script">
#!/bin/bash

TOGGLE_FILE="/tmp/hypr_float_minimized"

# Function to check if any floating window is visible
any_floating_visible() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -e '.[] | select(.floating == true and .mapped == true)' > /dev/null
}

# Function to minimize all floating windows
minimize_floating() {
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true and .mapped == true) | .address' | while read -r window; do
        hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "special:minimized,address:$window"
    done
    echo "minimized" > "$TOGGLE_FILE"
}

# Function to restore all minimized floating windows
restore_floating() {
    current_workspace=$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r '.workspace.id')
    hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true and .workspace.name == "special:minimized") | .address' | while read -r window; do
        hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace "$current_workspace,address:$window"
    done
    rm -f "$TOGGLE_FILE"
}

# Main toggle logic
if [ -f "$TOGGLE_FILE" ]; then
    # Floating windows were minimized, so restore them
    restore_floating
    # Focus the last floating window
    hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == true) | .address' | tail -n1)"
else
    if any_floating_visible; then
        # Floating windows are visible, so minimize them
        minimize_floating
        # Focus the last tiled window
        hyprctl dispatch focuswindow "address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.floating == false) | .address' | tail -n1)"
    else
        # No floating windows visible, do nothing
        echo "No floating windows to toggle"
    fi
fi
</antArtifact>

Here are the key changes and improvements:

1. We now use a toggle file (`/tmp/hypr_float_minimized`) to keep track of the state. This ensures we can reliably toggle between minimized and restored states.

2. The `any_floating_visible()` function now checks for `mapped == true` instead of `hidden == false`, which is more reliable in Hyprland.

3. In the `restore_floating()` function, we now move windows to the current active workspace instead of a generic "e+0".

4. The main logic now first checks if windows were previously minimized (by checking for the toggle file) before deciding what action to take.

5. We've added a case for when there are no floating windows to toggle, to prevent unexpected behavior.

To use this updated script:

1. Replace the content of your existing script (e.g., `~/.config/hypr/float_tile_toggle.sh`) with this new code.
2. Make sure it's still executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/float_tile_toggle.sh`
3. Your existing keybinding should still work.

This script should now properly toggle between minimizing all floating windows and restoring them. When you press the keybind:

- If floating windows are visible, they'll be minimized, and focus will shift to a tiled window.
- If floating windows were previously minimized, they'll be restored to their original workspace, and focus will shift to a floating window.
- If there are no floating windows, it will simply inform you (you can remove this message if you prefer silent operation).

Give this a try and let me know if it works better for you now. If you're still experiencing issues, we might need to look into your specific Hyprland configuration or version to troubleshoot further. Would you like me to explain any part of this script in more detail?

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:37:02 UTC

woo! i think it brought 'em all back! haha

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:37:02 UTC

 That's fantastic news! I'm really glad to hear it worked and brought all your floating windows back. It's always satisfying when we can get things working smoothly, especially with window management which can be quite tricky.

Now that it's working, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Behavior: This toggle will now switch between two states - all floating windows visible, or all floating windows minimized. It's an all-or-nothing approach, which can be very useful for quickly decluttering your workspace or bringing back all your tools.

2. Workspace Awareness: The script is designed to work with your current workspace, so it should only affect floating windows on your active workspace.

3. Performance: If you have a large number of floating windows, you might notice a slight delay when toggling, as the script has to process each window individually.

4. Customization: Feel free to modify the script if you want to tweak its behavior. For example, you could add notifications to indicate when windows are minimized or restored.

5. Keybinding: Make sure you're comfortable with the keybinding you've set for this toggle. It's a powerful tool, so you'll want it easily accessible but not so easy to hit accidentally.

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or any other window management tasks you're looking to optimize in Hyprland? I'd be happy to help you refine your setup further or explain any part of the script in more detail.

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:37:52 UTC

it's kind of like the special/magic workspace, i just don't have to remember to send windows there to begin with. haha

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:37:52 UTC

 You've made an excellent observation! You're absolutely right. This toggle script we've created is indeed very similar in concept to the special/magic workspace in Hyprland, but with some key advantages:

1. Automatic Management: As you pointed out, you don't have to manually send windows to this "special" space. The script does it automatically for all floating windows.

2. Easy Toggling: With a single keybind, you can switch between showing all floating windows and hiding them all, which is more convenient than manually moving windows to and from a magic workspace.

3. Preserved Window State: When you bring the windows back, they return to their original positions on the workspace, unlike a true separate workspace where you might need to rearrange them.

4. Focus Management: The script automatically handles focus, moving it to tiled windows when floating ones are hidden and back to a floating window when they're restored.

5. Workspace-Aware: Unlike a global magic workspace, this operates on a per-workspace basis, maintaining separation between different workspaces if you use multiple.

Your analogy to the magic workspace is spot-on and shows a good understanding of window management concepts. This script essentially creates a "virtual" magic workspace for floating windows that you can toggle with ease.

It's a great example of how you can extend and customize Hyprland's functionality to suit your specific workflow needs. By creating this toggle, you've essentially crafted your own "magic workspace" feature that's tailored to how you prefer to manage floating windows.

Do you have any other Hyprland features you'd like to customize in a similar way? Or perhaps you've thought of a way to further improve this floating window toggle?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:40:10 UTC

 Certainly! I'd be happy to help you set up window rules for Spotify in Hyprland, along with the autostart configuration. Let's break this down into two parts: the window rules and the autostart configuration.

1. Window Rules for Spotify:

<antThinking>These window rules are concise but important for the user's setup. While not extensive, they're specific enough to warrant an artifact for easy reference and modification.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-spotify-rules" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprland Window Rules for Spotify">
# Spotify window rules
windowrule = workspace 6 silent,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = minsize 500 300,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = float,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = minimize,^(Spotify)$
</antArtifact>

Add these lines to your Hyprland configuration file (usually `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`). Here's what each rule does:

- `workspace 6 silent`: Moves Spotify to workspace 6 without switching to that workspace.
- `minsize 500 300`: Sets a minimum size for the Spotify window.
- `float`: Makes the Spotify window floating by default.
- `minimize`: Starts Spotify in a minimized state.

2. Autostart Configuration:

For the autostart configuration, you'll need to add an entry to your `autostart.sh` file. If you don't have one, create it in your Hyprland config directory (typically `~/.config/hypr/autostart.sh`).

Add this line to your `autostart.sh`:

```bash
spotify --minimized &
```

This will launch Spotify in a minimized state when Hyprland starts.

3. Ensuring autostart.sh is executed:

Make sure your `hyprland.conf` includes a line to execute the `autostart.sh` script. It should look something like this:

```
exec-once = ~/.config/hypr/autostart.sh
```

4. Additional considerations for spotify-tui:

Since you mentioned using spotify-tui as your frontend, you might want to add a rule for it as well. If you're running spotify-tui in a terminal, you could add a rule like this:

```
windowrule = workspace 6,^(kitty-spotify-tui)$
```

Then in your `autostart.sh`, you could start spotify-tui in a dedicated terminal instance:

```bash
kitty --class kitty-spotify-tui -e spotify-tui &
```

Remember to replace `kitty` with your preferred terminal if you're using a different one.

To apply these changes:

1. Add the window rules to your `hyprland.conf`
2. Create or modify your `autostart.sh` to include the Spotify launch command
3. Ensure `autostart.sh` is being executed in your `hyprland.conf`
4. Restart Hyprland or log out and log back in

This setup should launch Spotify automatically on workspace 6 in a minimized state when you start Hyprland, allowing you to control it via spotify-tui and your Waybar widgets.

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail or help you with setting up the Waybar widgets for Spotify control?

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:40:10 UTC

hey, could you provide me with windowrules for spotify? i would love for it to launch at start (an entry in my autostart.sh) to workspace6, and start/remain minimized, i intend to use some waybar widges and spotify-tui as my frontend.

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:45:53 UTC

oops. my autostart is a .conf with a number of exec-once = lines, 

exec-once = spotify --minimized & seems like it should do the trick, no?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:45:53 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. Your approach is correct and more in line with Hyprland's typical configuration style. Let's update our setup to match your existing configuration:

1. Window Rules:
These remain the same as before. Add them to your `hyprland.conf`:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-spotify-rules" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprland Window Rules for Spotify">
# Spotify window rules
windowrule = workspace 6 silent,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = minsize 500 300,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = float,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = minimize,^(Spotify)$
</antArtifact>

2. Autostart Configuration:
Instead of a separate `autostart.sh` file, you'll add the Spotify launch command directly to your autostart.conf. Add this line:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-spotify-autostart" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprland Autostart Entry for Spotify">
exec-once = spotify --minimized &
</antArtifact>

You're correct that this should do the trick. The `exec-once` command ensures that Spotify is launched once when Hyprland starts, and the `--minimized` flag starts it in a minimized state.

3. Optional: spotify-tui setup
If you're using spotify-tui, you might want to add an entry for it as well:

```
exec-once = kitty --class kitty-spotify-tui -e spotify-tui &
```

And add a corresponding window rule:

```
windowrule = workspace 6,^(kitty-spotify-tui)$
```

Remember to replace `kitty` with your preferred terminal if you're using a different one.

With these changes:

1. Spotify will launch automatically when you start Hyprland.
2. It will be sent to workspace 6.
3. It will start in a minimized state.
4. The window will be floating and have a minimum size set.

This setup aligns perfectly with your existing configuration style and should integrate smoothly with your current Hyprland setup. The use of `exec-once` in your autostart.conf is indeed the correct and efficient way to handle autostarting applications in Hyprland.

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or any other aspects of your Hyprland configuration you'd like help with?

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:47:18 UTC

i believe the call for spotify-tui is spt

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:47:18 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and thank you for the correction. "spt" is indeed the correct command to launch spotify-tui. Let's update our configuration to reflect this:

1. For the Spotify-TUI autostart entry, we'll use:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-spotify-tui-autostart" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprland Autostart Entry for Spotify-TUI">
exec-once = kitty --class kitty-spotify-tui -e spt &
</antArtifact>

2. And let's keep our window rule for spotify-tui:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-spotify-tui-rule" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprland Window Rule for Spotify-TUI">
windowrule = workspace 6,^(kitty-spotify-tui)$
</antArtifact>

Remember to add these to your `hyprland.conf` file or your autostart configuration file, depending on your setup.

Here's a summary of what we have now:

1. For Spotify itself:
   ```
   exec-once = spotify --minimized &
   ```
   
2. For Spotify-TUI:
   ```
   exec-once = kitty --class kitty-spotify-tui -e spt &
   ```

3. Window rules:
   ```
   windowrule = workspace 6 silent,^(Spotify)$
   windowrule = minsize 500 300,^(Spotify)$
   windowrule = float,^(Spotify)$
   windowrule = minimize,^(Spotify)$
   windowrule = workspace 6,^(kitty-spotify-tui)$
   ```

This setup will:
- Launch both Spotify (minimized) and Spotify-TUI when Hyprland starts
- Place both on workspace 6
- Keep the Spotify window floating and minimized
- Open Spotify-TUI in a Kitty terminal instance

As before, if you're using a terminal other than Kitty, make sure to replace `kitty` with the appropriate command for your terminal emulator.

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or any other aspects of your Spotify or Hyprland setup you'd like to fine-tune?

---

**Human** - 2024-09-08 23:54:30 UTC

windowrules does not like the minimize rule for spotify

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-08 23:54:30 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and thank you for pointing that out. The `minimize` rule isn't a standard windowrule in Hyprland. Let's correct this and provide a working solution.

Instead of using a windowrule to minimize Spotify, we can use a dispatch command in combination with a window rule to achieve the same effect. Here's the updated configuration:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprland-spotify-rules-updated" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Updated Hyprland Window Rules and Autostart for Spotify">
# Spotify window rules
windowrule = workspace 6 silent,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = minsize 500 300,^(Spotify)$
windowrule = float,^(Spotify)$

# Autostart Spotify
exec-once = spotify --minimize

# Command to minimize Spotify after launch
exec-once = sleep 5 && hyprctl dispatch closewindow address:$(hyprctl clients -j | jq -r '.[] | select(.class == "Spotify") | .address')

# Spotify-TUI
exec-once = kitty --class kitty-spotify-tui -e spt &
windowrule = workspace 6,^(kitty-spotify-tui)$
</antArtifact>

Here's what changed and why:

1. We removed the invalid `minimize` windowrule.
2. We changed the Spotify launch command to use `--minimize` instead of `--minimized`.
3. We added a new `exec-once` command that waits for 5 seconds (to ensure Spotify has launched) and then uses `hyprctl` to minimize the Spotify window.

The `sleep 5` command gives Spotify time to launch before we try to minimize it. The `hyprctl` command finds the Spotify window and closes it, which in Hyprland effectively minimizes it.

This approach should work reliably to launch Spotify in a minimized state on workspace 6. The Spotify-TUI configuration remains the same.

If you find that Spotify takes longer to launch on your system, you might need to increase the sleep duration from 5 to a higher number.

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup further, or do you need help with any other aspects of your Hyprland configuration?
