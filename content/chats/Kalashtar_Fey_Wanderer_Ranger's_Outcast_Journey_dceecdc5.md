 Here's a biography for Kaelen, the Kalashtar Fey Wanderer Ranger with a multiclass into Spore Druid:

Kaelen, a Kalashtar born in the shadowy corners of Riedra, never truly felt at home among his own kind. From a young age, he sensed a pull towards something otherworldly, a connection that went beyond the psionic link to his quori spirit. This yearning led him to flee the oppressive regime of the Inspired, seeking freedom and understanding in the wilds of Khorvaire.

As he wandered the forests and fey-touched lands, Kaelen discovered his affinity for nature and the mysterious realms of the Feywild. He embraced the path of a Ranger, specifically the Fey Wanderer conclave, finding solace in the ethereal beauty and unpredictable nature of the fey. His kalashtar heritage, with its emphasis on mind-body harmony, blended seamlessly with the mystical aspects of his chosen path.

Kaelen's unusual background and fey-touched abilities often set him apart from others, making him something of an outcast in traditional societies. However, this isolation only deepened his connection to the natural world and the fungal networks that permeate it. Fascinated by the cycle of life, death, and rebirth embodied in the spores that float unseen through the air, Kaelen began to study the ways of the Spore Druid.

This unique combination of Fey Wanderer Ranger and Spore Druid has made Kaelen a formidable and enigmatic figure. He moves through the world with an otherworldly grace, equally at home in the vibrant courts of the Feywild and the dank, mushroom-filled caverns of the Underdark. His abilities allow him to charm and befuddle his foes, while also commanding the very essence of decay and rebirth.

Kaelen's constant companion is a mischievous fey spirit named Whisper, who takes the form of a will-o'-wisp. Together, they navigate the blurred lines between the material plane and the realms of fey, seeking to maintain balance and protect the wild places of the world from those who would exploit them.

Despite his solitary nature, Kaelen has found purpose in acting as a bridge between worlds – the material and the fey, the living and the dead, the mundane and the magical. His journey continues, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the hidden connections that bind all things in the multiverse.

 Thank you for providing that additional context. I'll revise Kaelen's backstory to include a specific fey-related event and adjust the description of his fey companion based on the Summon Fey spell. Here's an updated version:

Kaelen, born to Kalashtar parents in Riedra, always felt a disconnect between his quori-touched heritage and the world around him. As a young adult, he fled the oppressive regime of the Inspired, seeking freedom in the wilds of Khorvaire. Initially, Kaelen embraced the path of a traditional ranger, honing his skills in tracking, survival, and combat.

However, Kaelen's life took a dramatic turn during a seemingly routine scouting mission in the Towering Wood of the Eldeen Reaches. While tracking a group of poachers, he stumbled upon an ancient fey crossing - a shimmering veil between the material plane and the Feywild. Curiosity overwhelmed caution, and Kaelen stepped through.

What felt like mere moments in the Feywild translated to weeks in the material plane. During his time there, Kaelen encountered wondrous and terrifying fey creatures, navigated ever-changing landscapes, and was ultimately guided back to his own realm by a mischievous fey spirit named Whisper. This experience awakened something within Kaelen, altering his connection to nature and imbuing him with fey-touched abilities.

Upon his return, Kaelen found that his rangering skills had become infused with fey magic, leading him down the path of a Fey Wanderer. His newfound abilities and otherworldly experiences set him apart from his peers, often making him an outsider in traditional societies.

As Kaelen continued his journeys, he became fascinated by the cycle of life, death, and rebirth embodied in the fungal networks that permeate the natural world. This interest led him to study the ways of the Spore Druid, adding another layer of mystique to his already unusual skillset.

Now, Kaelen travels the lands as a protector of both the natural world and the delicate balance between the material plane and the Feywild. He uses his Summon Fey spell to call forth Whisper, the fey spirit who once guided him, maintaining a strong bond with his otherworldly companion.

Whisper typically manifests in a Tricksy mood, appearing as a slender, androgynous fey with skin that shimmers like moonlight on water. Their eyes sparkle with mischief, and their laughter sounds like tinkling bells. Whisper wields a shortsword that seems to be crafted from solidified starlight, leaving trails of glittering force energy with each swing.

In combat, Whisper darts around the battlefield, using Fey Step to confound enemies with magical darkness before striking with precise, forceful blows. Outside of battle, they serve as Kaelen's link to the Feywild, offering cryptic insights and occasionally leading him on whimsical detours that often turn out to be more significant than they first appear.

fey wanderers will have a "seemingly innocuous" event that exposes them to the feywilds. how they are introduced to the fey essentially.. he would have started out as just a ranger and then later be part of the fey. 

as for the companion, i like where you're at, but here's a little more information in order to produce something a little more along the lines of what i was thinking.. 

Summon Fey
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything
*3rd-level conjuration*
**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded flower worth at least 300 gp) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
You call forth a fey spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Fey Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a mood. Fuming, Mirthful, or Tricksy. The creature resembles a fey creature of your choice marked by the chosen mood, which determines one of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.
***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell’s level appears in the stat block.
***Spell Lists.*** Druid (Optional), Ranger (Optional), Warlock (Optional), Wizard (Optional)
Fey Spirit *Small fey* **Armor Class:** 12 + the level of the spell (natural armor) **Hit Points:** 30 + 10 for each spell level above 3rd **Speed:** 40 ft. STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 13 (+1) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) 16 (+3) **Condition Immunities:** charmed **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10 **Languages:** Sylvan, understands the languages you speak **Challenge:** — **Proficiency Bonus:** equals your bonus Actions ***Multiattack.*** The Fey makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell’s level (rounded down). ***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d6 + 3 + the spell’s level piercing damage + 1d6 force damage. Bonus Actions ***Fey Step.*** The fey magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Then one of the following effects occurs, based on the fey’s chosen mood. ***Fuming.*** The fey has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of this turn. ***Mirthful.*** The fey can force one creature it can see within 10 feet of it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. Unless the save succeeds, the target is charmed by you and the fey for 1 minute or until the target takes any damage. ***Tricksy.*** The fey can fill a 5-foot cube within 5 feet of it with magical darkness, which lasts until the end of its next turn.
