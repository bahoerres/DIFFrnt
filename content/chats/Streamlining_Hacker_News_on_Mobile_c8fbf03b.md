I want to start reading and keeping up with things on hacker news. However, I find the display overwhelming when navigating on mobile. Are there better options for viewing? Would there be a way to have articles of a certain type or content piped directly into my insta paper feed for ingestion on my own time?

 I understand wanting a more streamlined way to consume Hacker News (HN), especially on mobile. There are several good options:

For better mobile viewing:
1. HN Reader - A cleaner, more mobile-friendly web interface
2. Premii HN - A popular mobile-optimized web interface with customizable themes
3. Apps like MaterialHN for Android or MiniHack for iOS offer native mobile experiences

For filtering and saving specific content:
1. You can use RSS feeds with specific filters. For example:
- hnrss.org provides customizable RSS feeds
- You can filter by keywords, score threshold, or even specific domains
- These RSS feeds can be piped directly into Instapaper using its RSS integration

2. You could also use services like:
- HNDigest - Sends daily email digests of top stories
- HNMatch - Allows you to set up keyword alerts
- HNAPI - If you want to build a custom solution

Would you like me to explain how to set up any of these specific solutions in more detail? For example, I could walk through the process of setting up filtered RSS feeds to Instapaper.

I've long heard about and have a basic understanding of rss feeds, I think this would be an incredible thing for my ADHD brain. It all seems very daunting to set up. Or maybe I'm just making that up in my head.

 You're not alone in feeling this way! RSS can seem daunting at first, but it's actually pretty straightforward. Let me break down a simple way to get started:

1. First, you'll need an RSS reader. Some popular, user-friendly options:
- Feedly (very clean interface, great for beginners)
- Inoreader (powerful but still easy to use)
- NewsBlur (good mobile experience)

Let's walk through a super simple example to get you started:

1. Sign up for Feedly (it's free)
2. For Hacker News specifically, you can start with this basic feed URL:
   `https://hnrss.org/frontpage`

That's literally it for the basics! You'll start getting the top HN stories.

Once you're comfortable with that, you can get more specific. For example:
- Only stories with 100+ points: `https://hnrss.org/frontpage?points=100`
- Only stories about specific topics: `https://hnrss.org/frontpage?q=ADHD,productivity`

Would you like me to walk you through setting up your first RSS reader with these feeds? We can start super simple and add more complexity only if/when you want it.

The beauty of RSS for ADHD brains is that:
1. Everything comes to one place
2. No endless scrolling or distracting UI
3. You don't miss things if you don't check for a few days
4. You can read on your own schedule

Instapaper doesn't have RSS capabilities?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-03 21:38:23 UTC

 Actually, Instapaper does have RSS capabilities! While it's not as prominently featured as some of their other tools, you can set up RSS feeds to automatically send articles to your Instapaper account.

Here's how to set it up:

1. Log into your Instapaper account
2. Go to Settings
3. Look for the RSS settings section
4. You'll find a unique RSS feed URL that includes a private key - this is like your personal inbox address for RSS feeds

Once you have this feed URL, you can set up automation using a service like IFTTT (If This Then That) or Zapier to:
1. Watch an RSS feed (like the HN one: https://hnrss.org/frontpage)
2. Automatically send matching articles to your Instapaper account

Would you like me to walk you through setting up this kind of automation? We could start with a simple setup that sends all HN front page articles scoring above a certain threshold to your Instapaper.

(Also, heads up that if you're a premium Instapaper user, you get some additional RSS-related features, but the basic functionality works with a free account too!)
