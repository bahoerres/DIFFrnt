help me troubleshoot getting baldur's gate 3 to play on this device. steam has opened and downloaded the game, that part is fine. when i click the play button, i get to loading shaders dialog and then i get the steam client again, with the button back to being "play"

 Ah, classic Proton launch failure behavior. Let's troubleshoot this systematically.

First, let's check the Steam logs immediately after the crash:

```bash
tail -f ~/.local/share/Steam/logs/steam_log.txt
```

Also, let's specifically look at the Proton logs for BG3:

```bash
tail -f ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1086940/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Larian\ Studios/Baldur\'s\ Gate\ 3/errorlog.txt
```

Common culprits for this specific behavior on Arch+Hyprland:

1. First, verify Vulkan support:
```bash
vulkaninfo | grep "deviceName"
```

2. Make sure you have these packages installed:
```bash
paru -S lib32-vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-icd-loader lib32-mesa vulkan-mesa-layers
```

3. Try launching with these environment variables:
```bash
PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%
```

Add this to the Steam launch options for BG3 (right-click game → Properties → Launch Options).

If that doesn't work, let me know what the logs show and we can try more specific solutions. Also, what GPU are you running? That'll help narrow down potential fixes.

 Let's find where Steam is actually installed on your system. The paths can vary on Arch depending on how Steam was installed.

```bash
# Find Steam's install location
which steam
ls -la ~/.steam
```

Then let's check these common alternate log locations:

```bash
# Try these paths
ls -la ~/.steam/steam/logs/
ls -la ~/.steam/root/logs/
ls -la ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/logs/  # If using Flatpak
```

Also, let's see if Steam is running with any obvious issues:
```bash
journalctl --user-unit="steam" -f
```

And let's check your graphics setup while we're at it:
```bash
lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
vulkaninfo | grep -E "GPU|driver"
```

Once we find where Steam is actually logging, we can better track what's happening during the launch failure. Let me know what these commands show and we'll adjust our approach accordingly.

steam is either not collecting logs, or they're somewhere else..

 Perfect, we found the logs. Let's check the relevant ones while the game is failing to launch. Run these commands, then try launching BG3:

```bash
tail -f ~/.steam/steam/logs/compat_log.txt ~/.steam/steam/logs/console_log.txt
```

Also, check your graphics setup:
```bash
lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
```

While you're getting those logs, let's try a quick fix. Since you're on Hyprland/Wayland, add these launch options to BG3 in Steam (right-click → Properties → Launch Options):

```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 DXVK_ASYNC=1 gamemoderun %command%
```

First install gamemode if you haven't:
```bash
paru -S gamemode lib32-gamemode
```

Try launching with those options and share what the logs show when it fails. We'll adjust based on your GPU info and the error messages.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 20:39:28 UTC

 The logs show the game process is being created but immediately terminating (PID 157247 appears and disappears instantly). This is classic behavior for a graphics/Vulkan initialization failure.

Let's check your GPU and drivers:

```bash
lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
```

While we wait for that, let's also check for Vulkan issues:

```bash
vulkaninfo | grep "GPU id"
```

Then let's try launching with more verbose debug output. Add these launch options in Steam:

```bash
PROTON_LOG=1 VKD3D_DEBUG=warn PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 gamemoderun %command%
```

After trying to launch with these options, check:
```bash
tail -f "$HOME/proton_$USER.log"
```

Also make sure you have these packages installed:
```bash
paru -S vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools
```

The logs suggest the launcher starts but fails during initialization, which often means either:
1. Vulkan isn't properly set up
2. The game is trying to use the wrong GPU
3. There's a Wayland/Hyprland compatibility issue

Let me know what those commands show and we'll narrow it down.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 20:54:38 UTC

 Good news - your GPU and Vulkan setup looks correct. Since you're running an NVIDIA RTX 2070 on Hyprland, let's focus on Wayland/NVIDIA-specific fixes.

First, make sure you have the latest NVIDIA packages:
```bash
paru -S nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils
```

Then, let's create a specific set of launch options targeting NVIDIA/Wayland issues. In Steam, set these launch options for BG3:

```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1 NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland gamemoderun %command%
```

Also check your Hyprland config for proper NVIDIA settings. Add or verify these in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```bash
env = LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME,nvidia
env = XDG_SESSION_TYPE,wayland
env = GBM_BACKEND,nvidia-drm
env = __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME,nvidia
env = WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS,1
```

Try launching after making these changes. If it still fails, let's check the shader compilation logs:
```bash
ls -la ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/shadercache/1086940/
```

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 20:55:52 UTC

 Let's try a different approach to get the Proton logs. First, we need to modify the launch options to include a specific path:

```bash
PROTON_LOG=1 PROTON_LOG_DIR="$HOME/protonlogs" PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1 gamemoderun %command%
```

Then create the log directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/protonlogs
```

Now try launching the game again. After it fails, check:
```bash
ls -la ~/protonlogs/
tail -f ~/protonlogs/proton_*.log
```

Also, let's check if the game's base directory has any logs:
```bash
ls -la ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Baldurs\ Gate\ 3/
```

Since you're on NVIDIA/Hyprland, also verify your nvidia-drm kernel module is loaded properly:
```bash
lsmod | grep nvidia
```

 It seems Proton isn't creating logs even with our specified directory. Let's try a more direct debugging approach.

1. First, verify your Proton version in Steam:
```bash
ls -la ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton*
```

2. Let's check if Steam Runtime is working correctly:
```bash
ps aux | grep steam-runtime
```

3. Try forcing a specific Proton version. In Steam:
- Right-click BG3 → Properties
- Under Compatibility, check "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool"
- Select "Proton Experimental" 

Then modify the launch options to:
```bash
PROTON_USE_WINED3D=0 PROTON_DUMP_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1 PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1 gamemoderun %command%
```

4. Check if we have any DirectX/Vulkan related issues:
```bash
paru -S nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools
```

5. Let's also verify your NVIDIA kernel module status:
```bash
lsmod | grep nvidia
systemctl status nvidia-persistenced
```

Try launching after these changes. When it fails, immediately check:
```bash
journalctl -b 0 | grep -i vulkan
journalctl -b 0 | grep -i nvidia
```

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 20:58:44 UTC

 Let's focus on getting proper Proton setup first, then tackle the launch issue.

1. First, install Proton GE (it often has better compatibility):
```bash
paru -S proton-ge-custom
```

2. Create required Steam directories:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d
```

3. Let's verify and fix NVIDIA Vulkan settings:
```bash
sudo pacman -S vulkan-tools vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils
```

4. Create a custom Proton config:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/Steam/config/
cat > ~/.local/share/Steam/config/user_settings.py << EOF
user_settings = {
    "PROTON_USE_WINED3D": "0",
    "PROTON_NO_ESYNC": "1",
    "PROTON_NO_FSYNC": "1"
}
EOF
```

5. In Steam:
- Right-click BG3
- Properties → Compatibility
- Force Proton GE (or Proton Experimental if GE isn't available)
- Set these launch options:
```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json DXVK_ASYNC=1 gamemoderun %command%
```

6. Verify your Hyprland config has proper NVIDIA settings:
```bash
cat >> ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf << EOF
env = WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS,1
env = LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME,nvidia
env = __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME,nvidia
env = GBM_BACKEND,nvidia-drm

misc {
    force_hypr_chan=1
}
EOF
```

Try launching after these changes. If it still fails, we'll need to check:
```bash
journalctl -b 0 -p 3
```

**Human** - 2024-11-15 20:59:18 UTC

is there a preference between -bin and non-bin ?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 20:59:18 UTC

 For Proton GE, here's the key difference:

- `proton-ge-custom-bin`: Pre-compiled binary, faster to install
- `proton-ge-custom`: Builds from source, takes longer but potentially better optimized for your system

For most users, including gamers on Arch:
```bash
paru -S proton-ge-custom-bin
```

Reasons to choose -bin:
1. Much faster installation
2. Same functionality as compiled version for most use cases
3. Already well-tested binaries
4. Regular updates through AUR

The non-bin version is mainly useful if you:
1. Need specific compilation flags
2. Want to modify the source
3. Have very specific hardware optimizations in mind

For BG3 specifically, the -bin version is perfectly fine and saves you compilation time.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-15 20:59:54 UTC

that's been my stance as well. avoid -git and prefer -bin

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 20:59:54 UTC

 That's a solid approach for Arch package management. The general rules I follow:

1. Prefer `-bin` when:
- It's regularly updated
- It's a complex package (like Proton-GE, browsers)
- Compilation time > 10 minutes
- The package has many dependencies

2. Avoid `-git` unless:
- You need a specific unreleased fix
- You're actively testing/contributing
- The stable release is significantly outdated

3. Use base package when:
- You need specific compile flags
- The compilation is quick
- You want to patch something
- The `-bin` version lags behind

This strategy minimizes system maintenance overhead while keeping good performance. For gaming especially, `-bin` packages like `proton-ge-custom-bin`, `mangohud-bin`, etc. are usually the best choice.

Let's get that installed and proceed with the BG3 setup:
```bash
paru -S proton-ge-custom-bin
```

**Human** - 2024-11-15 21:00:35 UTC

i've also heard mention around the arch/hyprland circles of something called gamescope?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:00:35 UTC

 Ah yes, Gamescope is Valve's gaming compositor/window manager - particularly useful for Wayland setups. It can help with:

1. Better fullscreen handling
2. Improved frame pacing
3. Resolution scaling
4. Display refresh rate management

For your NVIDIA + Hyprland setup:

```bash
# Install gamescope and dependencies
paru -S gamescope lib32-gamescope

# Modified launch options for BG3 with gamescope
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia gamescope -W 2560 -H 1440 -f -r 144 -- gamemoderun %command%
```

Adjust the parameters based on your setup:
- `-W 2560 -H 1440`: Your desired resolution
- `-r 144`: Your monitor's refresh rate
- `-f`: Fullscreen mode
- Add `-w` instead of `-f` for windowed mode

Additional useful flags:
- `--adaptive-sync`: For VRR/G-Sync
- `--immediate-flips`: Can reduce latency
- `--borderless`: Borderless window mode

If you want to make Gamescope settings permanent for BG3, put these in the Steam launch options. It might help with the game's stability under Wayland.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:03:35 UTC

 These are different runtime environments for Steam games:

1. `Proton Experimental`
- Latest/bleeding edge Proton version
- Best for testing new games/features
- Gets frequent updates
- Usually good choice for newer games like BG3

2. `Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (sniper)`
- Container-based runtime
- Provides isolated environment
- Better compatibility with system libraries
- Good for troublesome games that need specific library versions

3. `Steam (runtime)`
- Basic Steam runtime
- Uses your system libraries
- Lighter weight
- Better for native Linux games

For BG3, you want `Proton Experimental` or your installed Proton-GE. The process:

1. Right-click BG3 → Properties
2. Compatibility → Force compatibility
3. Select either:
   - Proton-GE (recommended)
   - Proton Experimental (fallback)

Don't select `Steam Linux Runtime` or `Steam (runtime)` for BG3 - they're not meant for Windows games.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:05:52 UTC

 The game is still crashing quickly, but now we can see it's happening when gamescope tries to initialize. Let's try a few things:

1. First, try without gamescope to isolate if it's a gamescope issue:
```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json DXVK_ASYNC=1 gamemoderun %command%
```

2. If that still fails, let's verify all NVIDIA components:
```bash
paru -S nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils nvidia-settings vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader
```

3. Create a Vulkan configuration:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/vulkan/icd.d/
sudo ln -sf /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json /etc/vulkan/icd.d/
```

4. Check if the NVIDIA modules are loaded properly:
```bash
lsmod | grep nvidia
```

5. Look for specific errors:
```bash
journalctl -b 0 | grep -i vulkan
journalctl -b 0 | grep -i nvidia
```

If the basic launch still fails, try adding:
```bash
PROTON_LOG=1 DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=debug PROTON_DUMP_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1 PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json gamemoderun %command%
```

This will give us more detailed logging to see where exactly it's failing.

 Your NVIDIA modules are loaded correctly, but I notice this is running in a VM (`archlinux-vm`). This is important information - gaming in a VM with GPU passthrough can have additional complexities.

Let's modify our approach for the VM environment:

1. First, try these more VM-friendly launch options:
```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 gamemoderun %command%
```

2. Check your VM's GPU passthrough configuration:
```bash
# Check if IOMMU is enabled
dmesg | grep -i -e DMAR -e IOMMU

# Verify vfio status
lspci -nnk -d 10de:
```

3. Make sure these packages are installed for VM gaming:
```bash
paru -S looking-glass-host virt-manager qemu-desktop libvirt edk2-ovmf
```

4. In your VM's XML configuration (if using libvirt), ensure you have:
```xml
<features>
  <hyperv>
    <vendor_id state='on' value='123456789ab'/>
  </hyperv>
  <kvm>
    <hidden state='on'/>
  </kvm>
</features>
```

5. Try launching without gamescope first since it can be tricky in VMs:
```bash
PROTON_DEBUG_DIR=/tmp/proton_debug PROTON_LOG=1 PROTON_DUMP_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1 PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json %command%
```

After trying to launch, check:
```bash
cat /tmp/proton_debug/proton_$USER.log
```

Let me know what errors you see, and we can adjust the VM-specific settings accordingly.

hyprland has pretty extensive nvidia documentation. and vm. 

this vm is also a bit unique in that it's on a proxmox server, with the peripherals connected to it. kind of a vm/desktop with a server hidden underneath.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:10:17 UTC

 Ah, this is a Proxmox VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) setup! That's quite different from a typical gaming VM setup. This explains some things.

Let's tailor our approach for Proxmox VDI + Hyprland + NVIDIA:

1. First, verify your Hyprland NVIDIA settings in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:
```bash
env = LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME,nvidia
env = XDG_SESSION_TYPE,wayland
env = GBM_BACKEND,nvidia-drm
env = __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME,nvidia
env = WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS,1
env = XCURSOR_SIZE,24

# Nvidia-specific
env = __GL_GSYNC_ALLOWED,0
env = __GL_VRR_ALLOWED,0
env = WLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC,1

misc {
    no_direct_scanout = true
}
```

2. For BG3, let's try these Proxmox-optimized launch options:
```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json mesa_glthread=true DXVK_FRAME_RATE=144 gamemoderun %command%
```

3. Double-check your Proxmox VM configuration:
- Make sure PCI passthrough is configured with all NVIDIA devices (GPU, Audio, USB, Serial)
- Machine type should be q35
- CPU type should be host
- Add `args: -cpu 'host,+kvm_pv_unhalt,+kvm_pv_eoi,hv_vendor_id=NV43FIX,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff'` to your VM config

4. Install these packages for better Proxmox VM performance:
```bash
paru -S qemu-guest-agent spice-vdagent
systemctl enable --now qemu-guest-agent
```

This kind of setup (Proxmox VDI + Hyprland + Gaming) is pretty cutting edge. Let me know if this helps, and we can further tune based on what happens.

# Environment variables for theming and application behavior
env = GDK_BACKEND,wayland,x11
env = QT_QPA_PLATFORM,wayland;xcb

env = CLUTTER_BACKEND,wayland
# Set up GREETD_SOCK
env = GREETD_SOCK,$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/greetd.sock
env = XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP,Hyprland
env = XDG_SESSION_TYPE,wayland
env = XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP,Hyprland
env = QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR,1

env = __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME,nvidia
env = LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME,nvidia
# Cursor theme
env = XCURSOR_THEME,Bibata-Modern-Ice
env = XCURSOR_SIZE,24

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:11:58 UTC

 Your environment variables look good, but let's add a few more NVIDIA-specific ones, especially for gaming/Proxmox VDI. Add these to your Hyprland config:

```bash
# Existing environment variables remain...

# Additional NVIDIA optimizations
env = __GL_GSYNC_ALLOWED,0
env = __GL_VRR_ALLOWED,0
env = WLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC,1
env = PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI,1
env = __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS,1
env = __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE,1
env = __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH,$HOME/.cache/nv
env = PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU,0
env = NVD_BACKEND,direct

# Add these misc settings
misc {
    no_direct_scanout = true        # Fixes some screen sharing/recording issues
    disable_hyprland_logo = true
    disable_splash_rendering = true
    mouse_move_enables_dpms = true
    vrr = 0                         # Disable Variable Refresh Rate
    no_vfr = false                  # Needed for some games
}

# Add these to your device section if not already present
device {
    name = epic-mouse-v1
    sensitivity = -0.5
}
```

Then for BG3's launch options, try:
```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE=1 __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH="$HOME/.cache/nv" gamemoderun %command%
```

Create the NVIDIA shader cache directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cache/nv
```

These changes should help with the Proxmox VDI + Hyprland + NVIDIA gaming setup. The additional variables help with shader caching and NVIDIA optimization in a virtualized environment.

 12 }

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:13:19 UTC

 Let's merge the important NVIDIA-specific settings with your existing misc section. Here's how it should look:

```bash
misc {
    disable_hyprland_logo = true
    disable_splash_rendering = false
    mouse_move_enables_dpms = true
    enable_swallow = true
    swallow_regex = ^(kitty|Alacritty|floatcritty)$
    layers_hog_keyboard_focus = true
    vfr = false                    # Changed from true for better gaming compatibility
    vrr = 0
    animate_mouse_windowdragging = true
    allow_session_lock_restore = true
    force_default_wallpaper = -1
    no_direct_scanout = true      # Added for NVIDIA compatibility
}
```

And let's add a dedicated NVIDIA input settings block if you don't have one:

```bash
input {
    follow_mouse = 1
    sensitivity = 0
    accel_profile = flat      # Important for gaming
    force_no_accel = true     # Disable mouse acceleration
}

device {
    name = epic-mouse-v1
    sensitivity = -0.5
}
```

Then add any missing environment variables:
```bash
# Additional NVIDIA specific variables (add only the ones you don't already have)
env = __GL_GSYNC_ALLOWED,0
env = WLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC,1
env = __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS,1
env = __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE,1
env = __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH,$HOME/.cache/nv
env = NVD_BACKEND,direct
```

The key changes here are:
1. Setting `vfr = false` for better gaming compatibility
2. Adding `no_direct_scanout = true` for NVIDIA
3. Keeping your existing settings that work well

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:14:11 UTC

 Perfect, let's enhance your input configuration for gaming on NVIDIA/Proxmox. Here's the merged version:

```bash
input {
    kb_layout = us
    kb_variant = 
    kb_model =
    kb_options =
    numlock_by_default = true
    follow_mouse = 1
    mouse_refocus = false
    
    # Added gaming optimizations
    accel_profile = flat      # For consistent mouse movement
    force_no_accel = true     # Explicitly disable acceleration
    
    touchpad {
        natural_scroll = false
        scroll_factor = 1.0
    }
    
    sensitivity = 0  # Keeping your existing setting
}

# Add a device-specific section if you have a gaming mouse
device {
    name = epic-mouse-v1      # You can find your actual mouse name with 'hyprctl devices'
    sensitivity = 0
    accel_profile = flat
}

# Recommended gaming-specific window rules
windowrulev2 = immediate, class:^(steam_app_1086940)$  # For BG3
windowrulev2 = noanim, class:^(steam_app_1086940)$
windowrulev2 = noshadow, class:^(steam_app_1086940)$
```

Key additions:
1. `accel_profile = flat` for consistent mouse movement
2. `force_no_accel = true` to ensure no acceleration
3. Gaming-specific window rules for BG3

The window rules help reduce latency and potential rendering issues in the VM environment.

You can find your actual mouse name with:
```bash
hyprctl devices
```
Then adjust the device section accordingly.

no_direct_scanout must be deprecated, i'm getting an error

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:16:15 UTC

 Ah yes, you're right. Recent Hyprland versions have changed some options. Let's modify the misc section:

```bash
misc {
    disable_hyprland_logo = true
    disable_splash_rendering = false
    mouse_move_enables_dpms = true
    enable_swallow = true
    swallow_regex = ^(kitty|Alacritty|floatcritty)$
    layers_hog_keyboard_focus = true
    vfr = false                    # Better for gaming
    vrr = 0
    animate_mouse_windowdragging = true
    allow_session_lock_restore = true
    force_default_wallpaper = -1
    # no_direct_scanout = true    # Removed deprecated option
}

# Add a new GPU-specific section instead
group {
    col.group_border = rgba(00000000)
    col.group_border_active = rgba(00000000)
}

# If you have rendering issues, you might want to add:
env = WLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC,1
```

The GPU behavior that `no_direct_scanout` used to control is now handled automatically by Hyprland's newer versions. The focus should be on the environment variables and VRR/VFR settings for gaming optimization.

**Human** - 2024-11-15 21:30:19 UTC

well, it's currently passing 20% of vulkan shaders, which is more than i can say for any of our attempts thus far.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:30:19 UTC

 That's significant progress! The shader compilation actually starting means we've got the fundamental Vulkan/NVIDIA setup working correctly. Let's be patient and let it complete - first-time shader compilation can take a while, especially in a VM.

A few tips while it's compiling:

1. You can monitor GPU usage:
```bash
nvidia-smi -l 1
```

2. If you want to see what's happening under the hood:
```bash
tail -f ~/.local/share/Steam/logs/shader_log.txt
```

3. If it completes shader compilation but crashes on launch, we can try these additional launch options:
```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json DXVK_ASYNC=1 PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 gamemoderun %command%
```

Let's see if it completes the shader compilation successfully!

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:40:49 UTC

 That's btop showing quite a workout! Your i7-8700K is definitely earning its keep with those shader compilations - all cores running at 85-97%! The GPU usage is relatively low (17%) which is normal for shader compilation as it's primarily CPU-bound.

Interesting to see all those Electron processes too - looks like you're running quite a few Electron-based apps alongside Steam. Total memory usage looks healthy at 11.6GB with plenty of swap available.

Let the compilation finish - with those CPU numbers it's working hard. Since you're in a Proxmox VM, make sure you have enough CPU cores allocated (looks like you do with 6 cores showing good utilization) and that CPU pinning is configured properly if you're using it.

After compilation completes, subsequent launches should be much smoother since the shaders will be cached. Keep an eye on that GPU usage - it should spike up once you actually get into the game.

**Human** - 2024-11-15 21:41:45 UTC

i'm fairly certain obsidian is electron, i'd be willing to bet the todoist app is, zen-browser maybe?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:41:45 UTC

 Yeah, you've got quite the Electron collection there! Let's identify them from your btop output:

Confirmed Electron apps:
- `electron` (possibly Obsidian)
- `electron` (second instance)
- `todoist` (definitely Electron-based)
- Multiple `Isolated Web C` processes (these are Electron's sandboxed web contexts)
- `WebExtensions` (part of Electron's architecture)

"zen-bin" looks like it might be Zenity Browser or similar - also likely Electron-based.

This is pretty typical for modern development/productivity setups. Each Electron app essentially bundles its own Chromium instance, which explains the multiple similar processes and memory usage patterns. While they're convenient for cross-platform apps, they do add up in terms of resource usage.

If you're looking to optimize system resources while gaming, you might want to close some of these when running intensive games like BG3. Though with your CPU handling shader compilation at 85-97% while still running all these, you've clearly got enough headroom!

---

**Human** - 2024-11-15 21:43:37 UTC

scrolling to Isolated Web C and hitting enter , the deatils (i imagine) confirm zen


Attachments:
- 20241115_15h43m17s_grim.png

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:43:37 UTC

 Ah yes, that's definitely confirming ZenBrowser/Zen based on that process detail: `/opt/zen-bin/zen -contentproc -isForBrowser`. 

The flags like `-contentproc -isForBrowser` are classic Electron/Chromium-style process arguments, and the process hierarchy shows it's a content process (the actual web renderer) for the main Zen browser instance.

So your full Electron lineup is:
1. Obsidian
2. Todoist
3. Zen Browser
4. Various supporting processes for each (the `Isolated Web C` instances)

Each modern Electron app typically spawns:
- Main process
- Renderer process
- Several utility processes
- GPU process (shared if possible)

This architecture explains why you see multiple related processes in btop. It's quite efficient for modern CPUs to handle, but it's interesting to see it all laid out in the process viewer!

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:45:13 UTC

 Yes, there are several interesting issues showing up in the logs:

1. Vulkan initialization failure:
```
vkCreateInstance failed with error -9
BInit - Unable to initialize Vulkan!
```

2. It's trying to use Nouveau (open source NVIDIA driver) and failing:
```
glx: failed to create dri3 screen
failed to load driver: nouveau
```

3. Steam is warning about Wayland:
```
warning: SDL_VIDEODRIVER='wayland' does not allow fallback, use 'wayland,x11' instead
```

4. There's a launcher execution error:
```
/home/blake/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Baldurs Gate 3/Launcher/LariLauncher.exe: cannot execute binary file
```

Let's fix these:

1. First, modify your Steam launch options to include Wayland fallback:
```bash
SDL_VIDEODRIVER="wayland,x11" PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json gamemoderun %command%
```

2. Make sure Vulkan is properly set up:
```bash
sudo pacman -S vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils
```

3. Create/verify Vulkan ICD file:
```bash
sudo ln -sf /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json /etc/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json
```

4. Try launching Steam with:
```bash
STEAM_FORCE_VULKAN_DRIVER=nvidia steam
```

The logs show that it's both having trouble with Vulkan initialization and the game launcher execution, which explains the immediate crashes we were seeing earlier.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-15 21:45:56 UTC

 Yes! There are a few different levels where you can set launch options:

1. Steam Client Launch Options (when starting Steam itself):
```bash
# From terminal or .desktop file
STEAM_FORCE_VULKAN_DRIVER=nvidia steam
```

2. Individual Game Properties (what we've been doing):
- Right-click game → Properties → Launch Options
- These only apply to that specific game

3. Steam's own environment file:
```bash
# Create/edit ~/.config/environment.d/steam.conf
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland,x11
STEAM_FORCE_VULKAN_DRIVER=nvidia
__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia
```

4. Through your desktop environment (Hyprland):
```bash
# In ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER,wayland,x11
env = STEAM_FORCE_VULKAN_DRIVER,nvidia
```

For your setup, I'd recommend setting the global Vulkan/NVIDIA variables in your Hyprland config, and keeping game-specific options (like PROTON settings) in the game properties. This gives you the best of both worlds - proper system integration and per-game tweaking ability.

**Human** - 2024-11-15 21:45:56 UTC

are there different "steam launch" options than the individual game properties?
