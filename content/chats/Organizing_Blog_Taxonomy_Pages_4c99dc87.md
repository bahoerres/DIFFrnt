**Human** - 2024-07-28 23:39:06 UTC

having some troubles trying to sort my blog into taxonomy pages.. i've found a couple of guides and am tyring to use this routes.yaml but not having a ton of luck.. 

routes: 

routes:
  /:
    template: page
    data: page.home
collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:blog
  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:homelab
  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:wellness

it results in the attached screenshot.. i'm also attaching the guides i found to see if we can make any headway together.

- {'file_name': 'Ghost Themes - Dynamic URLs & Routing.md', 'file_size': 20422, 'file_type': '', 'extracted_content': "Routing is the system that maps URL patterns to data and templates within Ghost. It comes pre-configured by default, but it can also be customized extensively to build powerful custom site structures.\n\nAll of Ghost’s routing configuration is defined in `content/settings/routes.yaml` - which you can edit directly, but you can also upload/download this file from within your Ghost admin panel under `Settings » Labs`.\n\nIf you edit the file manually, you’ll need to restart Ghost to see the changes, but if you upload the file in admin then your routes will automatically be updated right away.\n\n### Base configuration\n\nThe default `routes.yaml` which comes with all new installs of Ghost sets things up with a traditional publication structure. The homepage of the site is a reverse-chronological list of the site’s posts, with each post living on its own URL defined by a `{slug}` parameter, such as `my-great-post`. There are also additional archives of posts sorted by tag and author.\n\n```yaml\n## routes.yaml routes: collections: /: permalink: /{slug}/ template: index taxonomies: tag: /tag/{slug}/ author: /author/{slug}/\n```\n\nFor most publications and use cases, this structure is exactly what’s needed and it’s not necessary to make any edits in order to use Ghost or develop a theme for it.\n\n### What’s YAML?\n\nYAML stands for **Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup **L**anguage - because there aren’t enough unfunny acronyms in computer science. You can think of it loosely like JSON without all the brackets and commas. In short, it’s a document format used to store nested `key:value` pairs, commonly used for simple/readable configuration.\n\nThe most important thing to know when working with YAML is that it uses indentation to denote structure. That means the **only** type of nesting which works is **2 spaces**.\n\nThe most common reason for YAML files not working is when you accidentally use the wrong type or quantity of spacing for indentation. So keep a close eye on that!\n\n### When to use dynamic routing\n\nMaybe you want your homepage to be a simple landing page, while all of your posts appear on `site.com/writing/`. Maybe you actually want to split your site into two main collections of content, like `/blog/` and `/podcast/`. Maybe you just want to change the URL of your archives from `/tag/news/` to `/archive/news/`.\n\nIf you’re looking to create an alternative site structure to the one described above, then dynamic routing is what you need in order to achieve all your hopes and dreams.\n\nOkay, maybe not all your hopes and dreams but at least your URLs. We’ll start there.\n\nHopes and dreams come later.\n\n## Custom Routes\n\nTemplate routes allow you to map individual URLs to specific template files within a Ghost theme. For example: make `/custom/` load `custom.hbs`\n\nUsing template routes is very minimal. There’s no default data associated with them, so there isn’t any content automatically loaded in from Ghost like there is with posts and pages. Instead, you can write all the custom code you like into a specific file, and then have that file load on the route of your choice.\n\nCustom routes are handy for creating static pages outside of Ghost Admin, when you don’t want them to be editable, they use lots of custom code, or you need to create a specific custom URL with more than a basic slug.\n\nDon’t worry, we’ll go through some examples of all of the above!\n\n___\n\n### Basic routing\n\nThe [default routes.yaml file](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/) which comes with Ghost contains an empty section under `routes`, and this is where custom routes can be defined.\n\nLet’s say you’ve got a big **Features** landing page with all sorts of animations and custom HTML. Rather than trying to cram all the code into the Ghost editor and hope for the best, you can instead store the code in a custom template called `features.hbs` - and then point a custom route at it:\n\n```yaml\nroutes: /features/: features\n```\n\nThe first half is the URL: `site.com/features/` - the second is the template which will be used: `features.hbs` - you leave off the `.hbs` because Ghost takes care of that part. Now you’ve created a new static page in Ghost, without using the admin!\n\nYou can also use custom routes to simulate subdirectories. For example, if you want a “Team” page to appear, for navigational purposes, as if it’s a subpage of your “About” page.\n\n```yaml\nroutes: /features/: features /about/team/: team\n```\n\nNow `site.com/about/team/` is a dedicated URL for a static `team.hbs` template within your theme. Routes can be just about anything you like using letters, numbers, slashes, hyphens, and underscores.\n\n___\n\n### Loading data\n\nThe downside of using an `/about/team` route to point at a static `team.hbs` template is that it’s… well: static.\n\nUnlike the **Features** the team page needs to be updated fairly regularly with a list of team members; so it would be inconvenient to have to do that in code each time. What we really want is to keep the custom route, but have the page still use data stored in Ghost. This is where the `data` property comes in.\n\n```yaml\nroutes: /features/: features /about/team/: template: team data: page.team\n```\n\nThis will assign all of the data from a Ghost **page** with a slug of `team` to the new route, and it will also automatically redirect the original URL of the content to the new one.\n\nNow, the data from `site.com/team/` will be available inside the `{{#page}}` block helper in a custom `team.hbs` template on `site.com/about/team/` and the old URL will redirect to the new one, to prevent the content being duplicated in two places.\n\n___\n\n### Building feeds & APIs\n\nIn the examples used so far, routes have been configured to generate a single page, some data and a template, but that’s not all routes can do. You can make a route output just about anything, for instance a custom RSS feed or JSON endpoint.\n\nIf you create a custom template file with a [{{#get}}](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/helpers/get/) helper API query loading a list of filtered posts, you can return those posts on a custom route with custom formatting.\n\n```yaml\nroutes: /podcast/rss/: template: podcast-feed content_type: text/xml\n```\n\nGenerally, routes render HTML, but you can override that by specifying a `content_type` property with a custom mime-type.\n\nFor example, you might want to build a custom RSS feed to get all posts tagged with `podcast` and deliver them to iTunes. In fact, [here’s a full tutorial](https://ghost.org/docs/tutorials/custom-rss-feed/) for how to do that.\n\nOr perhaps you’d like to build your own little public JSON API of breaking news, and provide it to other people to be able to consume your most important updates inside their websites and applications? That’s fine too, you’d just pass `json` as the `content_type`.\n\n## Collections\n\nCollections are the backbone of how posts on a Ghost site are organized, as well as what URLs they live on.\n\nYou can think of collections as major sections of a site that represent distinct and separate types of content, for example: `blog` and `podcast`.\n\n**Collections serve two main purposes:**\n\n1.  To display all posts contained within them on a paginated index route\n2.  To determine the URL structure of their posts and where they ’live’ on the site. For this reason, posts can only ever be in **one** collection.\n\nA post must either be a blog or a podcast, it can’t be both.\n\n___\n\n### The default collection\n\nThe [default routes.yaml file](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/) which comes with Ghost contains just a single collection on the root `/` URL which defines the entire structure of the site.\n\n```yaml\ncollections: /: permalink: /{slug}/ template: index\n```\n\nHere, the home route of `site.com` will display all posts, using the `index.hbs` template file, and render each post on a URL determined by the `{slug}` created in the Ghost editor.\n\nIn short: This is exactly how and why Ghost works by default!\n\n___\n\n### Using a custom homepage\n\nOne of the most minimal examples of editing the default collection is to move it to a new location and make room for a custom home page.\n\n```yaml\nroutes: /: home collections: /blog/: permalink: /blog/{slug}/ template: index\n```\n\nUsing an example from the previous section on [custom routes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/#routes), the home `/` route is now pointing at a static template called `home.hbs` — and the main collection has now been moved to load on `site.com/blog/`. Each post URL is also prefixed with `/blog/`.\n\n___\n\n### Filtering collections\n\nMuch like the [{{#get}}](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/helpers/get/) helper, collections can be filtered to contain only a subset of content on your site, rather than all of it.\n\n```yaml\ncollections: /blog/: permalink: /blog/{slug}/ template: blog filter: primary_tag:blog /podcast/: permalink: /podcast/{slug}/ template: podcast filter: primary_tag:podcast\n```\n\nReturning to the earlier example, all of the posts within Ghost here are divided into two collections of `blog` and `podcast`.\n\n#### Blog collection\n\n-   **Appears on:** `site.com/blog/`\n-   **Post URLs:** `site.com/blog/my-story/`\n-   **Contains posts with:** a `primary_tag` of `blog`\n\n#### Podcast collection\n\n-   **Appears on:** `site.com/podcast/`\n-   **Post URLs:** `site.com/podcast/my-episode/`\n-   **Contains posts with:** a `primary_tag` of `podcast`\n\nThe `primary_tag` property is simply the _first_ tag that is entered in the tag list inside Ghost’s editor. It’s useful to filter against the **primary** tag because it will always be unique.\n\nIf posts match the filter property for _multiple_ collections this can lead to problems with post rendering and collection pagination, so it’s important to try and always keep collection filters unique from one another.\n\n___\n\n### Doing more with collections\n\nCollections are an incredibly powerful way to organize your content and your site structure, so its only limits are your imagination — and our clichés.\n\n#### Loading data into the index\n\nMuch like [custom routes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/#routes), collections can also accept a data property in order to pass in the data to the collection’s index. For example, you might have a collection called `portfolio` which lists all of your most recent work. But how do you set the title, description, and metadata for _that_ collection index?\n\n```yaml\ncollections: /portfolio/: permalink: /work/{slug}/ template: work filter: primary_tag:work data: tag.work\n```\n\nNow, your `work.hbs` template will have access to all of the data (and metadata) from your `work` tag. And don’t forget: `site.com/tag/work/` will now also be redirected to `site.com/portfolio/` — so no duplicate content!\n\n#### Creating multi-lang sites\n\nAnother really popular use for collections is for sites that publish content in multiple languages and want to create distinct areas and URL patterns for each locale.\n\n```yaml\ncollections: /: permalink: /{slug}/ template: index filter: 'tag:-hash-de' /de/: permalink: /de/{slug}/ template: index-de filter: 'tag:hash-de'\n```\n\nThis would set the base URL to be in the site’s default language, and add an additional `site.com/de/` section for all posts in German, tagged with a private tag of `#de`. Using [Private tags](https://ghost.org/help/organizing-content/#internal-tags) means these tags wouldn’t be shown on the front end but can still be treated differently with Handlebars templating. The main collection excludes these same posts to avoid any overlap.\n\n## Taxonomies\n\nTaxonomies are groupings of posts based on a common relation. In Ghost, this is always defined by the post’s author or tag\n\nUsing taxonomies, Ghost will automatically generate post archives for tags and authors like `/tag/getting-started/` which will render a list of associated content.\n\nUnlike [collections](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/#collections), posts can appear in multiple taxonomies, and the post’s URL is not affected by which taxonomies are applied.\n\nTaxonomies are structured like this:\n\n```yaml\ntaxonomies: tag: /tag/{slug}/ author: /author/{slug}/\n```\n\nIf a post by `Cameron` is tagged with `News` then it will be included in archives appearing on:\n\n-   `site.com` – (The collection index)\n-   `site.com/author/cameron`\n-   `site.com/tag/news/`\n\nEach of these comes with its own automatically generated RSS feeds that are accessed by adding /rss/ to the end of the URL.\n\n___\n\n### Customising taxonomies\n\nThe configuration options for taxonomies are a lot more basic than [routes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/#routes) and [collections](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/#collections). You can’t define new or custom taxonomies, you can only modify those which are already there and adapt their syntax a small amount.\n\n```yaml\ntaxonomies: tag: /topic/{slug}/ author: /host/{slug}/\n```\n\nIf you don’t like the prefixes for taxonomies, you can customize them to something else that suits your site and your content better. If you’re running a publication that is primarily a podcast, for example, you might prefer `host` and `topic`.\n\n___\n\n### Removing taxonomies\n\nOne small extra trick is that you can actually remove taxonomies entirely and not generate those pages for your site. If you prefer to keep things minimal, just leave the taxonomies field empty.\n\n```yaml\ntaxonomies: ## Nothing but silence\n```\n\nJust make sure you also update your template files to not link to any tag or author archives, which will now 404!\n\n## Channels\n\nIf you want something more flexible than taxonomies, but less rigid than collections, then channels might be for you.\n\nA channel is a custom stream of paginated content matching a specific filter. This allows you to create subsets and supersets of content by combining or dividing existing posts into content hubs.\n\nUnlike [collections](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/#collections), channels have no influence over a post’s URL or location within the site, so posts can belong to any number of channels.\n\n**The best way to think of channels is as a set of permanent search results.** It’s a filtered slice of content from across your site, without modifying the content itself.\n\n___\n\n### Creating a channel\n\nChannels are defined as a [custom route](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/#routes), with a custom `controller` property called `channel`, and a filter to determine which posts to return.\n\n```yaml\nroutes: /apple-news/: controller: channel filter: tag:[iphone,ipad,mac] /editors-column/: controller: channel filter: tag:column+primary_author:cameron\n```\n\nIn this example, there are two channels. The first is a channel that will return any posts tagged `iPhone`, `iPad` or `Mac` on a custom route of `site.com/apple-news/`.\n\nThe second is a special Editor’s Column area, which will return any posts tagged with `Column`, but only if they’re explicitly authored by `Cameron`.\n\nThese are two small examples of how you can use channels to include and exclude groups of posts from appearing together on a custom paginated route, with full automatic RSS feeds included as standard. Just add `/rss/` to any channel URL to get the feed.\n\n___\n\n### When to use channels vs collections\n\nCollections and channels share a lot of similarities because they’re both methods of filtering a set of posts and returning them on a custom URL.\n\nSo how do you know when to use which?\n\n#### You should generally use a collection when…\n\nThere’s a need to define permanent site structure and information architecture\n\n-   **You’re sorting different types/formats of content**  \n    _eg. posts are blog posts OR podcasts_\n-   **You’re filtering incompatible content**  \n    _eg. posts are either in English OR German_\n-   **You want the parent filter to influence the post’s URL**  \n    _eg. an index page called `/news/` and posts like `/news/my-story/`_\n\n#### You might be better off with a channel if…\n\nAll you need is a computed view of a subsection of existing content\n\n-   **You’re combining/grouping different pieces of content**  \n    _eg. posts tagged with `news` AND `featured`_\n-   **You’re dividing existing streams of content with multiple properties**  \n    _eg. posts tagged with `news` but NOT authored by `steve`_\n-   **You want to be able to update/change properties without affecting post URLs**  \n    _eg. quickly creating/destroying new sections of a site without any risk_\n\nIf you’re still not sure which is the best fit for you, drop by the [Ghost Forums](https://forum.ghost.org/) and share what structure you’re hoping to accomplish. There’s a large community of Ghost developers around to help.\n\n## Index of all available properties\n\n## Redirects\n\nIn addition to creating routes, you can also create redirects for any time there are any changes in your URLs and you need to forward visitors\n\n### Accessing the redirects file\n\n> If you’ve updated your site from an earlier version (prior to 4.0), your redirects may be in JSON format. Both formats are still supported, but JSON support will be removed in a later version.\n\nThe `redirects.yaml` file is located in `content/data/redirects.yaml` and - like `routes.yaml` - can also be downloaded/uploaded in the settings in Ghost Admin.\n\n### File structure\n\nRefer to [Implementing redirects in Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/tutorials/implementing-redirects/) for more details about the file structure.\n\n### Implementation\n\nUpload your new `redirects.yaml` file in Ghost admin in the settings. This is the recommended method.\n\nTo replace the YAML file on the server, ensure it exists in `content/data/redirects.yaml` and restart Ghost for your changes to take effect.\n\n### When not to use `redirects.yaml`\n\nThere are some instances where it is not recommended to use the `redirects.yaml` file:\n\n-   Page rules for www or HTTP/HTTPS redirection should always be implemented with your DNS provider.\n-   Ghost automatically forces trailing slashes, so you do not need to write any page rules to accommodate for duplicate content caused by this.\n-   If you’re trying to change the URL structure of your publication, the recommended way to do this is with dynamic routing and the `routes.yaml` file. (However, you may still need to redirect existing content using `redirects.yaml`).\n\n## Final Tips\n\nGhost’s dynamic routing system is an extremely powerful way to build advanced structures for your site, and it’s hard to document every possible example of what can be done with it in comprehensive detail.\n\n### Detailed tutorials\n\nWhile these docs cover simple examples and broad use cases, you’ll find more detailed and specific use cases of how to build different types of publications in these tutorials:\n\n-   [Make an iTunes Podcast RSS feed](https://ghost.org/tutorials/custom-rss-feed/)\n-   [Use a custom homepage](https://ghost.org/tutorials/custom-homepage/)\n-   [How to build specialized content hubs](https://ghost.org/tutorials/content-collections/)\n-   [Define a custom order for posts](https://ghost.org/tutorials/change-post-order/)\n\nHead over to the [Ghost tutorials](https://ghost.org/tutorials/) section to find even more tutorials about how to build different types of themes and websites with Ghost.\n\n___\n\n### Limitations & troubleshooting\n\nAs you work further with dynamic routing it’s worth keeping in mind that there are some limitations to what you’re able to do with it. Here are a few of the most common areas where you’ll find the edges of what’s possible:\n\n##### Slugs can conflict\n\nDynamic routing has no concept of what slugs are used in Ghost, and vice-versa. So if you create a route called `/about/` and a page in Ghost called `about` then one of them is going to work, but not both. You’ll need to manage this manually.\n\n##### Collections must be unique\n\nIf you have a collection filtering for posts tagged with `camera` and another filtering for posts tagged with `news` - then you will run into problems if a post is tagged with both `camera` and `news`. You should either trust your authors to use the correct tags, or base collections on properties that are always unique, like `primary_tag`.\n\n##### Trailing slashes are required\n\nYou probably noticed that all the examples here use trailing slashes on routes, which is because these are required for dynamic routing to function correctly."}
- {'file_name': 'How to build a custom homepage for your Ghost theme.md', 'file_size': 16404, 'file_type': '', 'extracted_content': 'The flexibility of Ghost themes means it’s possible to add a custom homepage to your site using HTML, CSS, and Handlebars (Ghost’s templating language).\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build a custom homepage by adding a hero section that shares more context about your publication and introduces you to new visitors who land on your site.\n\nCustomizing your homepage requires editing code in your theme. While we’ll use Ghost’s default [Casper theme](https://demo.ghost.io/?ref=ghost.org) as a starting point and walk you through the process, you’ll want to have [downloaded a code editor](https://ghost.org/tutorials/download-a-code-editor/) and opened a [local copy of your theme.](https://ghost.org/tutorials/download-and-upload-a-theme/)\n\n💡\n\nWhat you are looking for may already exist! Before creating a custom homepage, check out the [themes in our marketplace](https://ghost.org/themes?ref=ghost.org) to see if one exists that already meets your needs. Our new theme, [Solo](https://solo.ghost.io/?ref=ghost.org), is tailor-made for individual creators.\n\nWe’re going to build a custom home page for Carol. She owns a nursery that grows carnivorous plants like Venus flytraps and uses Ghost to promote her business and engage with her community.\n\nHere’s a preview of the custom homepage we’re going to build:\n\n![Website for Carol\'s Carnivorous Plants featuring images of carnivorous and copy about Carol](https://ghost.org/tutorials/content/images/2023/02/carnivorous.png)\n\n## Create the homepage template\n\nBegin by [opening your theme in a code editor](https://ghost.org/tutorials/open-a-theme-in-a-code-editor/). In the root folder, create a new file called `home.hbs`. Ghost recognizes `home.hbs` as a special file and will automatically use it as your custom homepage.\n\nEvery Ghost theme has a file called `default.hbs`. It’s where you put elements that you want to show up on every page like your metadata, navigation, and footer.\n\nBy adding `{{!< default}}` to the top of `home.hbs`, we tell Ghost to insert our custom content into the default template. Now, the custom homepage includes the theme\'s navbar, footer, and other default elements.\n\n```handlebars\n{{!< default}}\n```\n\nThe first line of `home.hbs`\n\n### Add a hero section\n\nLet’s start adding in the custom content for the hero section, which introduces Carol and her business. It also has two call-to-action buttons and the publication’s feature image.\n\n![Her section with feature image, title, copy, and call to action buttons](https://ghost.org/tutorials/content/images/2023/02/carnivorous-1.png)\n\nThe code for this section is below. Lines that begin with `{{!` are comments that explain what the code is doing. Adapt the content to suit your publication.\n\n```handlebars\n<section class="p-outer"> <div class="p-inner p-hero"> <div class="p-hero-left"> <div> <h1>Welcome, Plant Lovers 👋</h1> <p>This is <strong>Carol\'s Carnivorous Plants</strong>, and, as you may have guessed, I\'m Carol.</p> <p>I grow carnivorous plants and <em>live</em>to write about it.</p> <p>I\'ve been growing, breeding, studying, and loving these plants for more than 25 years.</p> <p>Join me at my <a href="https://plantsbycarol.com"> nursery</a> or right here for Venus flytraps, sundews, Sarracenias, and more.</p> </div> <div class="p-hero-buttons"> {{! Launches the Ghost membership portal }} <button data-portal="signup">Subscribe</button> {{! Link to an about page }} <a href="/about/">Learn more &rarr;</a> </div> </div> <div class="p-hero-right"> {{! Loads the your cover image as defined in Ghost admin }} <img src="{{img_url @site.cover_image size="l"}}" alt="Pitcher plants" /> </div> </div> </section>\n```\n\n### Bring in the posts\n\nNow that we have Carol’s hero section, it’s time to bring in her posts. This section features up to 25 of the most recent posts. (You can configure the number of posts in your theme’s `package.json` file, under the `posts_per_page` property.)\n\nOur design showcases the post’s feature image and title:\n\n![Posts displayed as cards with a feature image and title](https://ghost.org/tutorials/content/images/2022/09/posts.png)\n\nAnd here’s the code for this section:\n\n```handlebars\n<section class="p-outer"> <div class="p-inner"> <h2>Latest Articles</h2> <div class="p-posts-grid"> {{! Use the foreach helper to loop through available posts }} {{#foreach posts}} <article class="p-post-card"> {{! Use the img_url helper to bring in the post\'s feature image. }} <img src="{{img_url feature_image size="m"}}" alt="{{feature_image_alt}}" /> <h3><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3> </article> {{/foreach}} </div> </div> </section>\n```\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nNow it’s time to combine the hero and posts sections and wrap everything in a `<main>` tag. The entire code is below.\n\n```handlebars\n{{!< default}} <main id="main"> <section class="p-outer"> <div class="p-inner p-hero"> <div class="p-hero-left"> <div> <h1>Welcome, Plant Lovers 👋</h1> <p>This is <strong>Carol\'s Carnivorous Plants</strong>, and, as you may have guessed, I\'m Carol.</p> <p>I grow carnivorous plants and <em>live</em>to write about it.</p> <p>I\'ve been growing, breeding, studying, and loving these plants for more than 25 years.</p> <p>Join me at my <a href="https://plantsbycarol.com"> nursery</a> or right here for Venus flytraps, sundews, Sarracenias, and more.</p> </div> <div class="p-hero-buttons"> {{!

Let’s add some CSS styling to ensure everything displays properly.\n\nCreate a new CSS file called `home.css`. Add it to the folder where you have your other CSS files. With Casper, that\'s in `assets/css`. Copy the styles below and add them to the new file.\n\n```css\n/* These styles override the Casper navbar defaults */ .home-template * { color: #000; } .home-template.has-cover .gh-head-button { color: #fff; background-color: var(--color-darkgrey); } /* Define the size of the sections */ .p-outer { padding: 14vmin max(4vmin, 20px) 0; } .p-outer:first-of-type { background-color: rgb(55 99 255 / 0.06); /* Light background color of hero section */ } .p-inner { max-width: 1200px; /* Defines the max width of your content */ margin-inline: auto; /* Centers the content */ } /* Hero section */ .p-hero { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 3.2vmin; } .p-hero-left { display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: space-between; /* Ensures buttons are at the bottom of the container */ } .p-hero-right img { width: 100%; max-height: 300px; object-fit: cover; /* Fills the container with the image */ transform: translateY(24px); /* Move the image slightly to create an offset effect */ } .p-hero h1 { text-transform: uppercase; } .p-hero p { font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; } .p-hero p + p { margin-top: 1.6rem; } .p-hero-left a { color: var(--ghost-accent-color); /* Color links with the Ghost accent color defined in Admin */ } .p-hero-buttons { display: flex; gap: 1.6rem; margin-block-start: 8vmin; } .p-hero-buttons button, .p-hero-buttons a { display: inline-flex; align-items: center; padding: 8px 16px; font-size: 1.6rem; font-weight: 700; color: #fff; letter-spacing: -0.005em; background-color: var(--ghost-accent-color); border: 3px solid var(--ghost-accent-color); border-radius: 6px; } .p-hero-buttons a { color: var(--ghost-accent-color); background-color: transparent; border: 3px solid; transition: all 0.2s; } .p-hero-buttons a:hover { color: #fff; background-color: var(--ghost-accent-color); border-color: var(--ghost-accent-color); } /* Posts */ .p-post-container { margin-block: 10.2vmin; margin-inline: auto; } .p-post-container h2 { text-transform: uppercase; } .p-posts-grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); /* Define a post grid, where cards can be minimum 300px and maximum the size of the column */ gap: 4vmin; } .p-post-card img { width: 100%; max-height: 500px; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; /* All images will have an HD image ratio */ object-fit: cover; } .p-post-card h3 { padding-inline: 10px; margin-block: 10px 0; } .p-post-card a:hover { color: var(--ghost-accent-color); } /* Change layout at larger viewport sizes */ @media (min-width: 768px) { .p-hero { grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* Hero section has 2 columns */ } .p-hero-buttons { transform: translateY(50%); /* Offset buttons */ } .p-hero-right img { max-height: none; aspect-ratio: 1 / 1; /* Make the image a square */ filter: drop-shadow(2px 3px 10px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.25)); /* Add a shadow*/ object-fit: contain; /* But also ensure it\'s not cropped */ object-position: right; /* Position image to far right */ } }\n```\n\nIncorporate your new CSS file into your theme\'s build step. With Casper, add an `import` statement in `screen.css`.\n\n![Code editor showing the new home.css file and importing it into screen.css](https://ghost.org/tutorials/content/images/2022/09/code-1.png)\n\n[Run your build command](https://ghost.org/tutorials/build-css-files/) to generate your CSS file.

Having separate sections will help them find what they’re looking for more quickly. Let’s help Carol create some sections!\n\n💡\n\nDefine these sections however you like. A news publication might use politics, sports, culture, etc. See our [Headline theme](https://headline.ghost.io/?ref=ghost.org) for an example of this implementation.\n\nWe can update our existing code to create these sections using Ghost’s powerful `[{{#get}}](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/helpers/get/?ref=ghost.org)` [helper](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/helpers/get/?ref=ghost.org). Not only does the `get` helper get posts, as the name implies, but it can also filter which posts it gets.\n\nIn our case, we’ll filter our posts based on their primary tags. For this to work, all posts must be tagged accordingly. For example, for a Venus flytrap section, Venus flytrap posts must have “Venus flytrap” as their first tag in the post editor.\n\nHere’s what this section of code looks like:\n\n```handlebars\n{{! First section}} <section class="p-outer"> <div class="p-inner"> <h2>Venus flytraps</h2> <div class="p-posts-grid"> {{! Use the get helper to fetch posts }} {{#get "posts" filter="primary_tag:venus-flytrap" limit="6" }} {{! Use the foreach helper to loop through available posts }} {{#foreach posts}} <article class="p-post-card"> {{! Use the img_url helper to bring in the post\'s feature image. }} <img src="{{img_url feature_image size="m"}}" alt="{{feature_image_alt}}" /> <h3><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3> </article> {{/foreach}} {{/get}} </div> </div> </section>\n```\n\nAfter bringing in the two other sections and updating `home.hbs`, here’s what the entire file looks like:\n\n```handlebars\n{{!< default}} <main id="main"> <section class="p-outer"> <div class="p-inner p-hero"> <div class="p-hero-left"> <div> <h1>Welcome, Plant Lovers 👋</h1> <p>This is <strong>Carol\'s Carnivorous Plants</strong>, and, as you may have guessed, I\'m Carol.</p> <p>I grow carnivorous plants and <em>live</em>to write about it.</p> <p>I\'ve been growing, breeding, studying, and loving these plants for more than 25 years.</p> <p>Join me at my <a href="https://plantsbycarol.com"> nursery</a> or right here for Venus flytraps, sundews, Sarracenias, and more.</p> </div> <div class="p-hero-buttons"> {{!

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 23:39:06 UTC

 Thank you for providing that information and screenshot. I can see you're trying to set up custom taxonomies for your blog using Ghost's routing system. Let's go through this step-by-step to troubleshoot and improve your setup:

1. Your routes.yaml file looks mostly correct, but there are a few adjustments we can make:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home
    data: page.home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:blog
  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:homelab
  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:wellness

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

Key changes:
- Changed the homepage template to 'home' instead of 'page'
- Adjusted the blog permalink to keep your main posts at the root level
- Added a taxonomies section to ensure tag and author pages are generated

2. Make sure you have corresponding template files in your theme:
   - `home.hbs` for your homepage
   - `index.hbs` for your post listings
   - `post.hbs` for individual post pages

3. In your Ghost admin panel, ensure that your posts are properly tagged with 'blog', 'homelab', or 'wellness' as their primary tag, depending on which section they should appear in.

4. After making these changes, restart your Ghost instance to apply the new routing rules.

5. If you're still seeing the "No posts" message, it could be because:
   - There are no posts with the specified tags
   - The posts exist but are not published
   - The filter is not matching any posts due to a mismatch in tag names

6. To debug, try temporarily removing the filters from your collections to see if posts appear. If they do, then the issue is likely with your tagging.

7. Also, check your Ghost admin panel to confirm that you have published posts with the correct tags.

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, you might want to check your Ghost logs for any error messages, and ensure that your theme is properly set up to display posts in the index.hbs template.

Remember, changes to the routes.yaml file require a restart of Ghost to take effect. If you're making changes through the Ghost admin panel, they should apply immediately.

Let me know if you need any clarification on these steps or if you're still encountering issues after trying them.

**Human** - 2024-07-28 23:41:32 UTC

my admin page doesnt seem to have a specified primary tag, but i've tried to set it up in such a way that each post has either homelab or wellness as the first tag listed, and blog more often than not is the second. even if not the second, i did make sure that every post contains the tag blog

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 23:41:32 UTC

 I see. Thank you for that clarification. The primary tag in Ghost is typically the first tag listed for a post, so your approach of putting homelab or wellness as the first tag should work. Let's adjust our strategy based on this information:

1. First, let's modify your routes.yaml file slightly:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home
    data: page.home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:blog
  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: primary_tag:homelab
  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: primary_tag:wellness

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

Key changes:
- We're now using `primary_tag` for homelab and wellness to ensure we're catching the first tag.
- The blog collection will catch all posts tagged with 'blog', regardless of position.

2. Make sure your Ghost version supports the `primary_tag` filter. It was introduced in Ghost 1.0, so if you're on an older version, you might need to update.

3. After making these changes, restart your Ghost instance to apply the new routing rules.

4. If you're still not seeing posts, let's try to diagnose further:

   a. In your Ghost admin, go to the "Labs" section and download your current routes.yaml file. Compare it with what you think you've set up to ensure the changes have been applied.

   b. Try accessing the individual collection URLs directly:
      - https://your-site.com/blog/
      - https://your-site.com/homelab/
      - https://your-site.com/wellness/

   c. If these URLs don't work, try accessing the tag pages directly:
      - https://your-site.com/tag/blog/
      - https://your-site.com/tag/homelab/
      - https://your-site.com/tag/wellness/

5. If the tag pages work but the collection pages don't, the issue might be with your theme's index.hbs file. Make sure it's set up to display posts correctly.

6. You can also try adding a debug collection to see all posts:

```yaml
collections:
  /all-posts/:
    permalink: /all/{slug}/
    template: index
```

This should show all your posts, helping you determine if the issue is with routing or if there's a problem with post visibility.

7. Check your Ghost logs for any error messages related to routing or template rendering.

8. Verify that your posts are published and not in a draft state.

If you're still encountering issues after trying these steps, it might be helpful to:
- Check the exact spelling and capitalization of your tags in the admin panel
- Temporarily simplify your routes.yaml to just one collection and see if that works
- Consider resetting your routes to default and gradually re-adding your custom routes

Let me know the results after trying these steps, and we can continue troubleshooting from there if needed.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:05:25 UTC

 You're right, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Let's clarify the situation:

1. By default, Ghost doesn't automatically sort posts into different taxonomies based on tags. All posts typically end up under the main blog URL structure (often /blog/ or just / depending on your setup).

2. To achieve the kind of taxonomy sorting you're looking for, you'll need to use Ghost's dynamic routing feature, which you've already started to implement with your routes.yaml file.

Given this understanding, let's revise our approach:

1. First, confirm your current setup:
   - Go to your Ghost admin panel
   - Navigate to Labs > Route settings
   - Download your current routes.yaml file to see what's actually in place

2. Now, let's modify your routes.yaml file to achieve the desired structure:

```yaml
collections:
  /:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index

  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:homelab'

  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:wellness'

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

Key points:
- The root collection (/) will contain all posts by default
- The /homelab/ and /wellness/ collections will filter posts based on their respective tags
- We've removed the /blog/ collection since all posts are already in the root collection

3. Upload this modified routes.yaml file in your Ghost admin panel (Labs > Route settings)

4. After uploading, Ghost should automatically apply these changes without needing a restart

5. Now, visit your site and check the following URLs:
   - Your main site URL (should show all posts)
   - /homelab/ (should show posts tagged with 'homelab')
   - /wellness/ (should show posts tagged with 'wellness')

6. If you're not seeing the expected results, check that:
   - Your posts are correctly tagged in the Ghost admin
   - The posts are published (not drafts)
   - Your theme's index.hbs file is set up to display posts correctly

7. You might also want to add links to these new sections in your site's navigation menu to make them easily accessible.

Remember, with this setup:
- All posts will appear on your main page
- Posts tagged 'homelab' will also appear under /homelab/
- Posts tagged 'wellness' will also appear under /wellness/
- A post can appear in multiple sections if it has multiple relevant tags

If you're still experiencing issues after implementing these changes, please let me know, and we can continue troubleshooting. It might be helpful to share any error messages you're seeing or screenshots of your Ghost admin panel (with sensitive information obscured) to get a clearer picture of your setup.

**Human** - 2024-07-29 00:05:25 UTC

so here's i think where things get a little sideways.. i don't know that ghost sorts taxonomy by default.. i'm pretty sure all posts end up under /blog/

---

**Human** - 2024-07-29 00:08:52 UTC

a couple notes: 

the main blogroll is back on my homepage at root. i want a custom homepage here. simply changing the collection back to /blog/ i think will do the trick there. 

homelab and wellness still kick blank pages (but not 404)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:08:52 UTC

 Thank you for those notes. I understand the situation better now. Let's adjust the approach to accommodate your custom homepage and troubleshoot the blank pages for homelab and wellness.

Here's an updated routes.yaml file that should address these issues:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home
    data: page.home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index

  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:homelab'

  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:wellness'

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

Key changes:
1. We've added back the custom homepage route.
2. The main blog is now under /blog/ as you requested.
3. We've kept the homelab and wellness collections.

Now, to troubleshoot the blank pages for homelab and wellness:

1. Verify tags: In your Ghost admin, check that you have posts tagged with exactly "homelab" and "wellness". The tags are case-sensitive.

2. Check post status: Ensure the tagged posts are published, not drafts.

3. Template issues: Make sure your theme's index.hbs file is set up to display posts. You might want to add some debug code to your index.hbs file to see what's being passed to it. For example:

   ```handlebars
   {{#if posts}}
     {{#foreach posts}}
       <h2>{{title}}</h2>
     {{/foreach}}
   {{else}}
     <p>No posts found. Debug info:</p>
     <pre>{{json this}}</pre>
   {{/if}}
   ```

   This will help you see if posts are being found but not displayed, or if no posts are being found at all.

4. Ghost API: Try accessing the Ghost API directly to see if it's returning posts:
   - For homelab: https://yourdomain.com/ghost/api/v3/content/posts/?key=YOUR_CONTENT_API_KEY&filter=tag:homelab
   - For wellness: https://yourdomain.com/ghost/api/v3/content/posts/?key=YOUR_CONTENT_API_KEY&filter=tag:wellness

   Replace YOUR_CONTENT_API_KEY with your actual Content API key, which you can find in Ghost Admin under Integrations.

5. Check Ghost logs: Look at your Ghost logs for any errors related to routing or querying posts.

6. Cache issues: If you're using any caching (either in Ghost or at the server level), try clearing it.

7. Ghost version: Ensure you're running a recent version of Ghost that fully supports dynamic routing.

After making these changes and checks:
1. Upload the new routes.yaml file in your Ghost admin.
2. Visit your homepage to ensure it's still custom.
3. Check /blog/ to see if your main blog roll is there.
4. Visit /homelab/ and /wellness/ to see if posts appear.

If you're still seeing blank pages for homelab and wellness after these steps, it would be helpful to know:
- What version of Ghost are you running?
- Can you share (with sensitive info removed) the output of the debug code if you add it to index.hbs?
- Are you able to see posts when you query the Ghost API directly?

This information will help us narrow down whether it's a routing issue, a template issue, or a data issue.

**Human** - 2024-07-29 00:09:25 UTC

if you give me a moment, i'll pull my index.hbs for you.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:09:25 UTC

 Certainly, take your time. Seeing your index.hbs file will be very helpful in diagnosing the issue. While you're retrieving that, a few things to keep in mind:

1. Make sure the index.hbs file is in the root of your theme directory.

2. The basic structure of an index.hbs file typically includes a loop to iterate through posts, something like this:

   ```handlebars
   {{#foreach posts}}
     <article>
       <h2><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h2>
       <p>{{excerpt}}</p>
     </article>
   {{/foreach}}
   ```

3. If your index.hbs is significantly different from this basic structure, it might explain why you're not seeing posts.

4. Also, check if there's any conditional logic in your index.hbs that might be preventing posts from displaying under certain conditions.

Once you share your index.hbs, we can review it together and identify any potential issues that might be causing the blank pages for your homelab and wellness sections.

what's the command to copy my ssh to key my id on the server?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:17:18 UTC

 The command to copy your SSH public key to a server is:

```
ssh-copy-id username@server_address
```

Where:
- `username` is your username on the remote server
- `server_address` is the IP address or domain name of your server

For example:
```
ssh-copy-id user@example.com
```

This command copies the contents of your public key file (usually `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` on your local machine) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server.

If you're using a non-standard SSH key file, you can specify it with the `-i` option:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub username@server_address
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted to enter the password for the remote account. Once you've done this, your public key will be added to the server, and you should be able to log in without a password in the future.

If `ssh-copy-id` is not available on your system (e.g., on some Windows systems), you can manually copy the contents of your public key file and append it to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server.

Remember to ensure that your SSH key pair is generated on your local machine before attempting to copy the public key to the server. If you haven't generated an SSH key pair yet, you can do so with the command:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

This will create a new 4096-bit RSA key pair.

**Human** - 2024-07-29 00:18:29 UTC

how about in wondows powershell? it doesn't like the command..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:18:29 UTC

 You're right, the `ssh-copy-id` command isn't natively available in Windows PowerShell. However, there are alternative methods to achieve the same result in PowerShell. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, ensure you have an SSH key pair. If not, generate one using:

   ```powershell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

2. Then, use the following PowerShell commands to copy your public key to the server:

   ```powershell
   $pubkeypath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub"
   $pubkey = Get-Content $pubkeypath | Out-String
   ssh user@example.com "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && echo '${pubkey}' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

   Replace `user@example.com` with your actual username and server address.

3. You'll be prompted to enter your password for the remote server.

If you're using a different key file, replace `id_rsa.pub` in the `$pubkeypath` variable with your actual public key filename.

Alternatively, if you have Git for Windows installed, you can use Git Bash, which includes `ssh-copy-id`. Open Git Bash and use the command as in Unix systems:

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@example.com
```

If you prefer a more PowerShell-native approach, you can create a function to mimic `ssh-copy-id`:

```powershell
function SSH-CopyId {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$RemoteHost,
        
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [string]$KeyFile="$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub"
    )
    
    $pubKey = Get-Content $KeyFile
    ssh "$RemoteHost" "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && echo '${pubKey}' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
}
```

Then use it like this:

```powershell
SSH-CopyId user@example.com
```

Remember to replace `user@example.com` with your actual username and server address. This function will use your default key (`id_rsa.pub`) unless you specify a different one.

 I see. It looks like you don't have an SSH key generated yet, or it's not in the default location. Let's go through the process of creating and using an SSH key in Windows:

1. First, let's generate an SSH key:

   Open PowerShell and run:

   ```powershell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

   When prompted for a file to save the key, just press Enter to use the default location.
   You can set a passphrase or leave it blank by pressing Enter again.

2. Now that you have generated a key, let's verify it exists:

   ```powershell
   Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
   ```

   This should display your public key.

3. If the key was created successfully, you can now use the following command to copy it to your server:

   ```powershell
   $pubkey = Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub"
   ssh user@your-server.com "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && echo '${pubkey}' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

   Replace `user@your-server.com` with your actual username and server address.

4. You'll be prompted to enter your password for the remote server.

If you're still having trouble, here are a few things to check:

- Make sure you're running PowerShell as your user, not as administrator (unless your user is the admin account).
- If you've generated the key in a different location, adjust the path in the commands accordingly.
- If you're using OpenSSH that comes with Windows 10 (version 1809 and later), the default location might be `$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`.

If you're still encountering issues, you can manually create the .ssh directory and generate the key there:

```powershell
mkdir "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa"
```

Then try the copy command again. Let me know if you're still having trouble after these steps.

what's the logic between server ip and server hostname? 172.232.30.83 or blakehoerres.com

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:20:36 UTC

 The choice between using a server IP address (like 172.232.30.83) or a hostname (like blakehoerres.com) depends on a few factors:

1. DNS Configuration:
   - If blakehoerres.com is properly set up in DNS to point to 172.232.30.83, you can use either interchangeably for most purposes.
   - Using the hostname relies on DNS resolution, which adds a small step but provides more flexibility.

2. Stability:
   - IP addresses might change (especially with dynamic IPs), while hostnames can remain constant.
   - If the IP changes, you only need to update DNS, not every place you've used the IP.

3. Human-readability:
   - Hostnames are generally easier for humans to remember and recognize.

4. SSL/TLS Certificates:
   - If you're using HTTPS, certificates are typically issued for hostnames, not IP addresses.

5. Virtual Hosting:
   - If the server hosts multiple sites, the hostname helps the server determine which site to serve.

6. Firewall and Network Rules:
   - Some network configurations might require use of IP addresses.

7. Direct Connection:
   - Using an IP address bypasses DNS lookup, which can be marginally faster or necessary if DNS is having issues.

For SSH and most administrative tasks, either should work if your DNS is set up correctly. However, using the hostname (blakehoerres.com) is generally recommended because:

1. It's more memorable.
2. It's more flexible if you need to change servers or IP addresses in the future.
3. It works seamlessly with SSL/TLS if you're using HTTPS.

So, for your SSH command, you could use:

```
ssh username@blakehoerres.com
```

This assumes your DNS is correctly configured. If you're having trouble connecting with the hostname, falling back to the IP address can help isolate whether the issue is with DNS resolution or the SSH connection itself.

blakehoerres.com is where the website is hosted.. i'd imagine that i can go ahead and use it here as well.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:21:29 UTC

 You're absolutely correct. If blakehoerres.com is where your website is hosted, you can indeed use it for SSH access as well. This is a common and recommended practice. Here's why:

1. Consistency: Using the same domain for both web hosting and SSH access keeps things simple and consistent.

2. DNS Management: You're already managing DNS for this domain, so it's convenient to use it for all server-related tasks.

3. Flexibility: If you ever need to change the server's IP address, you only need to update the DNS record, and all your access methods (web, SSH, etc.) will automatically point to the new IP.

4. Security: Using a domain can add a layer of obscurity compared to using a raw IP address.

So, you can use the following command to copy your SSH key:

```powershell
$pubkey = Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub"
ssh your-username@blakehoerres.com "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && echo '${pubkey}' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Replace `your-username` with the actual username you use to log into your server.

After this, you should be able to SSH into your server using:

```
ssh your-username@blakehoerres.com
```

This approach is not only valid but also a best practice for managing your server. It leverages your existing DNS setup and provides a more memorable and flexible way to access your server.

okay, back to hbs land. 

i think this might be the "home" that we're looking for.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:30:21 UTC

 Certainly! I'd be happy to take a look at your "home" HBS file. Could you please share the contents of that file? Once you provide the code, I can review it and offer suggestions on how to properly set up your custom homepage and ensure it's correctly integrated with your Ghost routing.

Remember, when sharing code snippets, it's helpful to format them by enclosing them in triple backticks (```) at the start and end of the code block. This makes the code easier to read and understand.

After you share the file contents, we can work on ensuring it's properly set up to be your custom homepage and troubleshoot any issues you might be experiencing with your homelab and wellness sections.

 Thank you for sharing the `default.hbs` file. This file is indeed crucial, but it's not the specific "home" template we're looking for to customize your homepage. The `default.hbs` file serves as the main layout template for your entire Ghost site, providing the overall structure that wraps around the content of individual pages.

To create a custom homepage, we need to focus on creating or modifying a file named `home.hbs`. This file should be in the root of your theme directory, alongside `default.hbs`.

Here's what you should do:

1. Create a new file named `home.hbs` in your theme's root directory if it doesn't already exist.

2. In this `home.hbs` file, you'll define the specific content and layout for your homepage. Here's a basic structure to start with:

```handlebars
{{!< default}}

<div class="home-template">
    <header class="site-home-header">
        {{> "site-header"}}
    </header>

    <main id="site-main" class="site-main">
        <div class="inner">
            <!-- Your custom homepage content goes here -->
            <h1>Welcome to {{@site.title}}</h1>
            <p>{{@site.description}}</p>

            <!-- You can add sections for recent posts, featured content, etc. -->
            <section class="recent-posts">
                <h2>Recent Posts</h2>
                {{#get "posts" limit="3"}}
                    {{#foreach posts}}
                        <article>
                            <h3><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
                            <p>{{excerpt}}</p>
                        </article>
                    {{/foreach}}
                {{/get}}
            </section>
        </div>
    </main>
</div>
```

3. Customize this `home.hbs` template to include the specific content and layout you want for your homepage.

4. Make sure your `routes.yaml` file (which you can edit in Ghost Admin under Labs > Route settings) includes a route for the homepage:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home
    data: page.home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index

  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:homelab'

  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:wellness'

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

This setup will use your custom `home.hbs` template for the homepage, while still maintaining separate sections for your blog, homelab, and wellness content.

After making these changes, restart your Ghost instance or re-upload your theme for the changes to take effect. 

If you already have a `home.hbs` file, please share its contents so we can review and modify it as needed for your custom homepage.

 Thank you for sharing the `index.hbs` file. This file is typically used for the main post listing page in Ghost themes. However, since you want a custom homepage, we'll need to create a separate `home.hbs` file for that purpose.

Let's create a `home.hbs` file that incorporates some elements from your `index.hbs`, but customized for a homepage layout. Here's a suggested structure:

1. Create a new file named `home.hbs` in your theme's root directory.

2. Add the following content to `home.hbs`:

```handlebars
{{!< default}}
{{#contentFor "mapache_class_body"}}is-home{{/contentFor}}

<div class="container mx-auto">
    {{!-- Hero Section --}}
    <section class="hero-section mb-16 p-8 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg">
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to {{@site.title}}</h1>
        <p class="text-xl">{{@site.description}}</p>
    </section>

    {{!-- Featured Posts Section --}}
    <section class="featured-posts mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Featured Posts</h2>
        <div class="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
            {{#get "posts" filter="featured:true" limit="3"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    {{> "story/story-grid" classTitle='text-xl'}}
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
        </div>
    </section>

    {{!-- Recent Posts Section --}}
    <section class="recent-posts mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Recent Posts</h2>
        <div class="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">
            {{#get "posts" limit="8"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    {{> "story/story-grid" classTitle='text-xl'}}
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
        </div>
    </section>

    {{!-- Categories Section --}}
    <section class="categories mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Categories</h2>
        <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4">
            {{#get "tags" limit="all"}}
                {{#foreach tags}}
                    <a href="{{url}}" class="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-full hover:bg-gray-300 dark:hover:bg-gray-600 transition">{{name}}</a>
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
        </div>
    </section>
</div>
```

3. Ensure your `routes.yaml` file (which you can edit in Ghost Admin under Labs > Route settings) includes a route for the homepage:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index

  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:homelab'

  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:wellness'

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

This setup will:
- Use your new `home.hbs` template for the homepage
- Keep the existing `index.hbs` for the main blog listing (accessible at /blog/)
- Maintain separate sections for homelab and wellness content

After making these changes:
1. If you're developing locally, restart your Ghost instance
2. If you're working on a live site, re-upload your theme

These changes should give you a custom homepage while maintaining your blog, homelab, and wellness sections. The homepage will feature a hero section, featured posts, recent posts, and a categories list. You can further customize this layout to fit your specific needs.

**Human** - 2024-07-29 00:36:15 UTC

oh right, this index will be the framework for /blog now

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 00:36:15 UTC

 You're absolutely correct! That's a great observation. Now that we're setting up a custom homepage with `home.hbs`, the `index.hbs` file will indeed serve as the template for your `/blog` route. This setup allows you to have a distinct homepage while maintaining a separate blog listing page.

Given this understanding, let's make sure your routing and templates are properly aligned:

1. Keep your current `index.hbs` as is. This will be perfect for your `/blog` route.

2. Ensure your `routes.yaml` file looks like this:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index

  /homelab/:
    permalink: /homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:homelab'

  /wellness/:
    permalink: /wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:wellness'

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

3. Create your new `home.hbs` file for your custom homepage. You can use the template I provided in the previous message as a starting point, or create your own custom layout.

4. If you want to maintain consistency between your homepage and blog listing page, you could incorporate elements from your `index.hbs` into your `home.hbs`. For example, you might want to use the same post card designs or layout structure.

5. Consider adding clear navigation links on your homepage to the `/blog`, `/homelab`, and `/wellness` sections.

With this setup:
- Visitors to your root URL (/) will see your custom homepage
- The `/blog` URL will show your full blog listing using the existing `index.hbs` template
- `/homelab` and `/wellness` will show filtered content based on tags

Remember to restart Ghost or re-upload your theme after making these changes. This approach gives you the flexibility to have a unique homepage while maintaining your existing blog structure and specialized sections.

 Thank you for sharing the `godo-home-personal.hbs` file. This appears to be a custom home page template that was likely part of your theme. It's a good starting point for creating your custom homepage. Let's adapt this template to fit your needs while incorporating elements from your existing setup.

Here's a modified version of `godo-home-personal.hbs` that you can use as your `home.hbs`:

```handlebars

This template:
1. Keeps the hero section from the original template, but uses your site title and description.
2. Adds three sections below the hero: Latest Blog Posts, Homelab, and Wellness.
3. Each section displays the three most recent posts from that category and includes a link to view all posts in that category.

To use this:
1. Save this content as `home.hbs` in your theme's root directory.
2. Make sure your `routes.yaml` file is set up correctly (as shown in previous messages).
3. Restart Ghost or re-upload your theme.

This setup gives you a custom homepage that showcases content from all your sections while maintaining separate pages for your blog, homelab, and wellness content. You can further customize the design and layout to match your preferences.

 I apologize for the confusion. Let's troubleshoot this step-by-step:

1. 404 on home page:
   This suggests that Ghost isn't recognizing your `home.hbs` file. Make sure:
   - The file is named exactly `home.hbs` (not `godo-home-personal.hbs` or anything else)
   - It's in the root directory of your theme
   - Your `routes.yaml` file is correctly set up

2. Blank pages for wellness and homelab:
   This could be due to the filter not working as expected. Let's try a different approach.

Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's simplify your `routes.yaml`. Replace its content with:

```yaml
collections:
  /:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

2. Rename your `godo-home-personal.hbs` to `home.hbs` if you haven't already.

3. Modify your `home.hbs` to this simplified version:

```handlebars
{{!< default}}

<div class="container mx-auto my-16">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Welcome to {{@site.title}}</h1>

    <div class="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-3">
        {{!-- Blog Section --}}
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Latest Blog Posts</h2>
            {{#get "posts" limit="3"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    <article class="mb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-xl"><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">{{excerpt words="20"}}</p>
                    </article>
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
        </section>

        {{!-- Homelab Section --}}
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Homelab</h2>
            {{#get "posts" filter="tag:homelab" limit="3"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    <article class="mb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-xl"><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">{{excerpt words="20"}}</p>
                    </article>
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
            <a href="/tag/homelab" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">View all homelab posts →</a>
        </section>

        {{!-- Wellness Section --}}
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Wellness</h2>
            {{#get "posts" filter="tag:wellness" limit="3"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    <article class="mb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-xl"><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">{{excerpt words="20"}}</p>
                    </article>
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
            <a href="/tag/wellness" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">View all wellness posts →</a>
        </section>
    </div>
</div>
```

4. After making these changes, restart Ghost or re-upload your theme.

This setup should:
- Display your custom homepage at the root URL
- Use the default tag pages for homelab and wellness (/tag/homelab and /tag/wellness)
- Display all posts on the main blog page

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check Ghost's error logs for any relevant messages
2. Verify that your posts are correctly tagged
3. Ensure you're using a recent version of Ghost
4. Try clearing your browser cache or testing in an incognito window

If the problem persists, we might need to look at your server configuration or Ghost settings. Let me know the results after trying these steps, and we can continue troubleshooting from there.

we're still missing the mark somewhere.. home is a 404, and both wellness and homelab are coming up blank.. for what it's worth, /tag/homelab gives me a sorted list of homelab tagged articles..

**Human** - 2024-07-29 01:00:28 UTC

i think this usage limit warning i'm getting means your brain's getting a little mushy.. i can see just by looking at it that the simplified routes is going to give a result that is not the one i want.

**Assistant** - 2024-07-29 01:00:28 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion and appreciate your patience. You're absolutely right, and I thank you for catching that. My previous suggestion was indeed not aligned with your goals. Let's take a step back and approach this with a fresh perspective.

Given that you want separate sections for blog, homelab, and wellness, and that /tag/homelab is working correctly, let's revise the approach:

1. Update your `routes.yaml` to this:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/
```

2. Keep your `home.hbs` file in the root of your theme directory.

3. Ensure your `index.hbs` file is present for the blog section.

4. For homelab and wellness, we'll use the tag pages instead of creating separate collections.

Now, let's modify your `home.hbs` to reflect this structure:

```handlebars
{{!< default}}

<div class="container mx-auto my-16">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Welcome to {{@site.title}}</h1>

    <div class="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-3">
        {{!-- Blog Section --}}
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Latest Blog Posts</h2>
            {{#get "posts" limit="3"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    <article class="mb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-xl"><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">{{excerpt words="20"}}</p>
                    </article>
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
            <a href="/blog" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">View all blog posts →</a>
        </section>

        {{!-- Homelab Section --}}
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Homelab</h2>
            {{#get "posts" filter="tag:homelab" limit="3"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    <article class="mb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-xl"><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">{{excerpt words="20"}}</p>
                    </article>
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
            <a href="/tag/homelab" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">View all homelab posts →</a>
        </section>

        {{!-- Wellness Section --}}
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Wellness</h2>
            {{#get "posts" filter="tag:wellness" limit="3"}}
                {{#foreach posts}}
                    <article class="mb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-xl"><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">{{excerpt words="20"}}</p>
                    </article>
                {{/foreach}}
            {{/get}}
            <a href="/tag/wellness" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">View all wellness posts →</a>
        </section>
    </div>
</div>
```

This setup should:
- Display your custom homepage at the root URL
- Have a separate /blog section for all posts
- Use the existing tag pages for homelab and wellness (/tag/homelab and /tag/wellness)

After making these changes:
1. Upload the updated `routes.yaml` file in the Ghost admin panel (Labs > Route settings)
2. Upload the updated theme files (including `home.hbs`)
3. Restart Ghost

This approach leverages the existing tag functionality for homelab and wellness while providing a custom homepage and a separate blog section. It should align better with your desired structure while working with Ghost's built-in capabilities.
