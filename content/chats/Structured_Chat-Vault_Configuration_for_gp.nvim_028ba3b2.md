# gp.nvim Configuration Project Overview
## Core Project Goals
We're building a comprehensive gp.nvim configuration that:
1. Integrates with a structured chat-vault system in `~/Documents/chat-vault/`
2. Uses smart-titling for automatic context-aware chat naming
3. Leverages multiple AI models strategically
4. Provides specialized agents for different use cases
## Technical Implementation Details
Currently implementing configuration at `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/gp.lua` with:
1. Directory Structure:
```
~/Documents/chat-vault/
├── chats/      # Organized chat storage
└── prompts/    # Domain-specific prompt libraries
    ├── technical/
    ├── personal/
    ├── rpg/
    └── professional/
```
2. Model Configuration:
- Latest Claude Models:
  - Claude 3.5 Series (Sonnet/Haiku 20241022)
  - Claude 3 Series (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- GPT-4 Turbo for variety
3. Smart Features:
- Automatic chat titling using GPT-4
- Environment-based API key management
- Specialized agent configurations
- Custom hooks for specific workflows
## Specialized Domains
Configuring agents and prompts for:
1. Technical Work:

Would you like to continue working on any particular aspect? We were specifically troubleshooting model configurations to ensure they're properly implemented and functional.
Note: Previous chat hit token limit while fine-tuning the Claude model configurations.


First though, i'm still going to need a bit of help troubleshooting these custom integrations for gp.nvim 

please see attached lua. errors below.

 Looking at the error messages, there appear to be two main issues with the Anthropic configuration:

1. The first error indicates that Anthropic's API doesn't accept "system" role messages in the same way OpenAI does. The Claude API expects a different format for system prompts.

2. The second error suggests there's an issue with message preparation where the code is trying to iterate over a nil value.

Let's modify the configuration to work with Anthropic's API format:

```lua
-- lua/plugins/gp.lua
return {
    "robitx/gp.nvim",
    config = function()
        local home = vim.fn.expand("~")
        local chat_vault_dir = home .. "/Documents/chat-vault"

        require("gp").setup({
            providers = {
                openai = {
                    -- OpenAI config remains the same
                    secret = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") or os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY"),
                },
                anthropic = {
                    endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
                    secret = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY") or os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_KEY"),
                    -- Adding API version header required by Anthropic
                    api_headers = {
                        ["anthropic-version"] = "2023-06-01",
                    },
                },
            },

            storage = {
                chat_dir = chat_vault_dir .. "/chats",

                    chat = true,
                    system_prompt = "You are a quick and efficient assistant, optimized for rapid responses. Maintain this role throughout our conversation.",
                },
                -- Specialized Agents
                {
                    name = "CodeAssist",
                    provider = "anthropic",
                    model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                    chat = false,
                    system_prompt = "You are a coding assistant focused on providing clear, efficient, and well-documented solutions. Maintain this role throughout our conversation.",
                },
                {

                    provider = "anthropic",
                    model = "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",

                },
            },
        })
    end,
}
```

Key changes made:

1. Added `api_headers` for Anthropic with the required API version.
2. Modified system prompts to work better with Anthropic's API format.
3. Ensured consistent formatting across all Anthropic model configurations.

If you're still experiencing issues, we should:

1. Verify your Anthropic API key is working (try it directly with curl)
2. Check if gp.nvim has been updated recently to support Anthropic's latest API
3. Consider trying with just one Anthropic agent first to isolate any issues

Would you like me to help you test the configuration with a simple curl command to verify the Anthropic API access?

 Based on the Anthropic API error and the target specification you found, let's modify the configuration to better handle the responses and specify the output format. Here's an updated version:

```lua

```

Key changes:
1. Updated Anthropic configuration to use latest API version
2. Changed system prompts to be part of initial messages
3. Added specific parameters for Anthropic responses
4. Set default target and filetype configurations
5. Added hooks example for custom behavior

Try using this configuration and let me know if you still get the empty response error. Also, you can test specific agents with:

```vim
:GpAgent Claude3.5-Sonnet
:GpChatNew
```

This should open a new chat buffer in markdown format. If you're still getting errors, we can try:
1. Simplifying to just one agent
2. Adding debug logging
3. Testing with curl to verify API access
4. Checking the plugin's issue tracker for similar problems

Would you like to try any of these troubleshooting steps?

**Human** - 2024-11-06 08:22:21 UTC

So, i had to add a system prompt for each agent and i seem to be having success. 

I'd like to know more about these hooks.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-06 08:22:21 UTC

 I'll help you understand hooks in gp.nvim - they're a powerful way to extend functionality. Let me show you some practical examples:



<antArtifact identifier="gp-hooks" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="lua" title="Custom gp.nvim Hook Examples">
-- Add these to the hooks = {} section of your gp.nvim config

hooks = {

1. A brief explanation of what it does
2. Potential improvements or optimizations
3. Any security concerns
4. Suggestions for better error handling

    end,

    -- Create a documentation generator
    DocGen = function(gp, params)

5. Reducing duplication
]]
        gp.Prompt(params, gp.Target.vnew(), gp.get_command_agent(), template)
    end,

    -- Create a specialized D&D encounter generator
    DndEncounter = function(gp, params)
        local template = [[
Please generate a D&D 5e encounter based on:
- Party size: {{command}} players
- Party level: Assume level 5

        -- Use your GameMaster agent for this
        local agent = gp.get_chat_agent("GameMaster")

</antArtifact>

These hooks become available as commands in Neovim prefixed with "Gp". For example:
- `:GpCodeGuru` - Analyzes selected code
- `:GpDocGen` - Generates documentation
- `:GpCommitMessageGen` - Helps write commit messages
- `:GpTestGen` - Generates unit tests
- `:GpDndEncounter` - Creates D&D encounters

Key aspects of hooks:
1. Each hook is a function that gets access to:
   - `gp`: The plugin object with all its methods
   - `params`: Command parameters like selected text range

2. They can use different targets:
   - `gp.Target.popup` - Shows in popup window
   - `gp.Target.enew()` - Creates new buffer
   - `gp.Target.vnew()` - Creates vertical split
   - `gp.Target.new()` - Creates horizontal split
   - `gp.Target.tabnew()` - Creates new tab

3. Templates can use variables:
   - `{{filename}}` - Current file name
   - `{{filetype}}` - Current file type
   - `{{selection}}` - Selected text
   - `{{command}}` - User input when prompted

4. You can use different agents for different purposes:
   - `gp.get_command_agent()` - Gets current command agent
   - `gp.get_command_agent("AgentName")` - Gets specific agent
   - `gp.get_chat_agent()` - Gets current chat agent
   - `gp.get_chat_agent("AgentName")` - Gets specific chat agent

Would you like me to:
1. Create more specialized hooks for your specific needs?
2. Explain more about how any particular hook works?
3. Show how to create hooks with different output formats?
