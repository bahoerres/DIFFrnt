i'm having a bunch of issues trying to setup a virtual machine and remote desktop. 

i've got manjaro sway set up and running as a vm on one of my proxmox servers. i can't for the life of me get my windows laptop to connect via remote desktop and havent even been able to find much in the way of good information.. 

can you help?

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 05:53:19 UTC

 I understand you're having trouble setting up remote desktop access to your Manjaro Sway virtual machine from your Windows laptop. This can be a bit tricky, as Sway (a Wayland compositor) doesn't natively support traditional remote desktop protocols. Let's break this down and explore some options:

1. Wayland vs X11:
   Sway uses Wayland, which doesn't have built-in remote desktop capabilities like X11. This is the primary reason you're having difficulty.

2. Possible solutions:

   a. Use X11 instead of Wayland:
      - You could switch to using X11 instead of Wayland. This would allow you to use traditional remote desktop solutions like VNC or XRDP.
      - To do this, you'd need to install a different desktop environment or window manager that uses X11.

   b. Use a Wayland-compatible remote desktop solution:
      - There are some options designed to work with Wayland, such as GNOME's screen sharing feature or WayVNC.
      - However, these might not integrate as smoothly with Windows RDP clients.

   c. Use a protocol-agnostic solution:
      - Tools like NoMachine or Apache Guacamole can work regardless of whether you're using X11 or Wayland.

3. Steps to try:

   a. Install and configure NoMachine:
      - Install NoMachine on both your Manjaro VM and Windows laptop.
      - Configure the NoMachine server on Manjaro.
      - Use the NoMachine client on Windows to connect.

   b. Set up Apache Guacamole:
      - Install Guacamole server on your Manjaro VM or another server.
      - Configure it to connect to your Manjaro VM.
      - Use a web browser on your Windows laptop to access the Guacamole interface.

   c. Switch to X11 and use XRDP:
      - Install a desktop environment that uses X11 (like XFCE or KDE).
      - Install and configure XRDP on your Manjaro VM.
      - Use the built-in Remote Desktop Connection tool on Windows to connect.

4. Network considerations:
   - Ensure that the necessary ports are open on your Proxmox host and Manjaro VM.
   - Check that your Windows laptop can reach the VM's IP address.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options or provide more detailed steps for a specific approach?

i was starting to look into wayvnc. that seems the most appealing and functions the most closely to what i want. 

i use mremoteng as my client on windows and it seems fairly full featured.

 Excellent, focusing on WayVNC is a good choice since it's designed to work with Wayland compositors like Sway. Let's go through the process of setting up WayVNC on your Manjaro Sway VM and connecting to it using mRemoteNG from your Windows laptop.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install WayVNC on your Manjaro Sway VM:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S wayvnc
   ```

2. Create a configuration file for WayVNC:
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.config/wayvnc
   nano ~/.config/wayvnc/config
   ```

3. Add the following basic configuration to the file:
   ```
   address=0.0.0.0
   enable_auth=true
   username=your_username
   password=your_password
   ```
   Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your desired credentials.

4. Start WayVNC:
   ```
   wayvnc
   ```
   You may want to create a systemd service to start WayVNC automatically on boot.

5. Ensure that the VNC port (default is 5900) is open on your Manjaro VM and Proxmox host.

6. On your Windows laptop, open mRemoteNG and set up a new connection:
   - Connection type: VNC
   - Hostname: Your Manjaro VM's IP address
   - Port: 5900 (default for VNC)
   - Username and Password: As set in the WayVNC config file

7. Try connecting using mRemoteNG.

If you encounter issues, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Check if WayVNC is running:
   ```
   ps aux | grep wayvnc
   ```

2. Verify that the port is open:
   ```
   sudo ss -tulpn | grep 5900
   ```

3. Check the Manjaro firewall:
   ```
   sudo ufw status
   ```
   If it's active, you may need to allow VNC:
   ```
   sudo ufw allow 5900/tcp
   ```

4. If you're still having trouble, try running WayVNC with verbose logging:
   ```
   wayvnc -v
   ```
   This will provide more information about what's happening during the connection attempt.

5. Ensure that your Proxmox server is properly forwarding the VNC port to your Manjaro VM.

Remember that WayVNC is still relatively new and may have some limitations or bugs. If you encounter persistent issues, you might want to consider alternatives like NoMachine or Apache Guacamole, which can offer more stable connections across different setups.

Would you like more information on any part of this setup process, or do you need help with any specific issues you're encountering?

**Human** - 2024-06-25 05:57:51 UTC

this doesnt seem quite right.. address=0.0.0.0
enable_auth=true
username=your_username
password=your_password

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 05:57:51 UTC

 You're right to question that configuration. I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct and improve the WayVNC configuration. Here's a more appropriate and secure setup:

1. Create the configuration file:
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.config/wayvnc
   nano ~/.config/wayvnc/config
   ```

2. Add the following to the file:
   ```
   address=127.0.0.1
   enable_auth=true
   username=your_username
   password=your_password
   ```

Explanation of changes:
- `address=127.0.0.1`: This restricts WayVNC to listen only on the loopback interface, which is more secure than 0.0.0.0 (which listens on all interfaces).
- Keep `enable_auth=true` to ensure authentication is required.
- Set your actual username and password.

3. For remote access, you'll need to use SSH tunneling. This is more secure than exposing the VNC port directly. Here's how to set it up:

   On your Windows machine, use a command like this (assuming you have SSH installed):
   ```
   ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 user@your_manjaro_vm_ip
   ```
   Replace `user` with your Manjaro username and `your_manjaro_vm_ip` with the VM's IP address.

4. In mRemoteNG, set up the connection like this:
   - Connection type: VNC
   - Hostname: localhost (or 127.0.0.1)
   - Port: 5900
   - Username and Password: As set in the WayVNC config file

5. Start WayVNC on your Manjaro VM:
   ```
   wayvnc
   ```

This setup is more secure because:
- The VNC server only listens on the local interface.
- All traffic is encrypted through the SSH tunnel.
- You don't need to open additional ports on your Proxmox host or Manjaro VM firewall.

I apologize again for the initial misleading configuration. This revised setup should provide a more secure and appropriate solution for your needs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions about this approach.

oh. one moment, that was the wrong scan.. 

ERROR: ../wayvnc/src/main.c: 522: WAYLAND_DISPLAY is not set in the environment
ERROR: ../wayvnc/src/main.c: 1871: Failed to initialise wayland
    /usr/bin 

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 05:58:39 UTC

 I see. Thank you for providing that error message. This error indicates that WayVNC is having trouble connecting to the Wayland display server. This is a common issue when trying to run WayVNC, especially if you're trying to start it remotely or from a non-graphical session. Let's troubleshoot this:

1. First, ensure you're running WayVNC from within a Sway session. WayVNC needs to be run from within the Wayland environment it's trying to capture.

2. Check if the WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable is set:
   ```
   echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY
   ```
   It should return something like `wayland-0` if you're in a Wayland session.

3. If you're trying to start WayVNC from an SSH session or a non-graphical environment, you'll need to run it as the user who owns the Wayland session. You can use `sudo` with the `-E` flag to preserve environment variables:
   ```
   sudo -E -u your_username wayvnc
   ```
   Replace `your_username` with the actual username of the account running the Sway session.

4. Another approach is to use `systemd-run` to run WayVNC in the user's graphical session:
   ```
   systemd-run --user wayvnc
   ```

5. If you're still having issues, you might need to explicitly set the WAYLAND_DISPLAY variable before running WayVNC:
   ```
   WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 wayvnc
   ```

6. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Wayland socket. Check the permissions of the socket file:
   ```
   ls -l $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-0
   ```
   Ensure your user has read and write permissions.

7. If you're running this in a VM, make sure the VM is actually booting into a graphical Sway session and not just a console.

8. As a last resort, you might need to restart your Sway session to ensure all environment variables are properly set.

If none of these solutions work, we might need to look into alternative methods for remote access or investigate if there's an issue with your Sway configuration. Let me know the results of trying these steps, and we can proceed from there.

**Human** - 2024-06-25 06:04:57 UTC

i went ahead and ran it as user blake from the terminal inside of the sway session in the proxmox shell.. i haven't gotten a return line.. i imagine it's just running at this point?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 06:04:57 UTC

 Yes, that sounds correct. If you ran WayVNC from within the Sway session as user blake and haven't received any error messages or a return to the command prompt, it's likely that WayVNC is now running successfully.

When WayVNC starts successfully, it typically doesn't produce any output and just runs in the foreground. This behavior is normal for many server processes.

To confirm that WayVNC is indeed running, you can try the following:

1. Open another terminal (or terminal emulator within Sway) and run:
   ```
   ps aux | grep wayvnc
   ```
   This should show you the running WayVNC process.

2. Check if it's listening on the expected port (default is 5900):
   ```
   ss -tulpn | grep 5900
   ```
   This should show that something (WayVNC) is listening on port 5900.

Now that WayVNC is likely running, you can try to connect to it from your Windows machine using mRemoteNG. Remember to set up the connection as we discussed earlier:

- Connection type: VNC
- Hostname: Your Manjaro VM's IP address
- Port: 5900
- Username and Password: As set in your WayVNC config file (if you set one up)

If you're still having trouble connecting, you might need to:

1. Ensure the VNC port (5900) is open on your Manjaro VM's firewall:
   ```
   sudo ufw allow 5900/tcp
   ```

2. Make sure the port is also allowed through your Proxmox host's firewall and properly forwarded to your VM.

3. Double-check that your Windows machine can reach the Manjaro VM's IP address (you can try pinging it).

If you encounter any issues during the connection attempt, please let me know, and we can troubleshoot further. Also, if you need to stop WayVNC at any point, you can use Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running, or find its process ID with `ps aux | grep wayvnc` and then use `kill <process_id>`.

**Human** - 2024-06-25 06:10:34 UTC

am i able to run wayvnc as a service? like could i set it to run at startup?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 06:10:34 UTC

 Absolutely! Running WayVNC as a service is an excellent idea for ensuring it starts automatically with your system. Here's how you can set up WayVNC to run as a systemd user service:

1. Create a systemd user service file:
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
   nano ~/.config/systemd/user/wayvnc.service
   ```

2. Add the following content to the file:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=WayVNC Server
   After=sway-session.target
   PartOf=sway-session.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/wayvnc
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=5s

   [Install]
   WantedBy=sway-session.target
   ```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Reload the systemd user daemon:
   ```
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   ```

5. Enable the service to start automatically with your user session:
   ```
   systemctl --user enable wayvnc.service
   ```

6. Start the service:
   ```
   systemctl --user start wayvnc.service
   ```

7. To ensure the user service can start on boot, you need to enable lingering for your user:
   ```
   sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
   ```

8. You can check the status of the service at any time with:
   ```
   systemctl --user status wayvnc.service
   ```

A few important notes:

- This setup assumes you're using Sway. The `sway-session.target` ensures that WayVNC starts after Sway is fully loaded.

- If you have a custom WayVNC configuration file, you might want to specify it in the ExecStart line, like this:
  ```
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/wayvnc /path/to/your/config
  ```

- If you need to run WayVNC with specific environment variables, you can add them using the `Environment=` directive in the `[Service]` section.

- Remember that this service will run in your user context, so it will only start when you log in. If you need it to start regardless of user login, you'd need to set up a system-wide service, which is more complex with Wayland/Sway.

With this setup, WayVNC should start automatically whenever you log into your Sway session. You can still control it manually using `systemctl --user` commands if needed.

i suppose we should get started troubleshooting.. 

Opening connection failed!
Unable to connect to the server. Error was: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 192.168.0.90:5900

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 06:15:05 UTC

 Thank you for providing that error message. This error indicates that the connection is being actively refused, which typically means one of a few things:

1. WayVNC is not running or not listening on the expected port.
2. A firewall is blocking the connection.
3. The IP address or port number is incorrect.

Let's troubleshoot step by step:

1. First, confirm WayVNC is running on your Manjaro VM:
   ```
   ps aux | grep wayvnc
   ```
   If it's not running, start it manually or via the systemd service we set up.

2. Check if WayVNC is listening on the correct port:
   ```
   ss -tulpn | grep 5900
   ```
   This should show WayVNC listening on port 5900.

3. Check the Manjaro firewall status:
   ```
   sudo ufw status
   ```
   If it's active, ensure port 5900 is allowed:
   ```
   sudo ufw allow 5900/tcp
   ```

4. Verify the IP address of your Manjaro VM:
   ```
   ip addr show
   ```
   Confirm it matches the IP you're trying to connect to (192.168.0.90).

5. From your Windows machine, try to telnet to the VM on port 5900:
   ```
   telnet 192.168.0.90 5900
   ```
   If this fails, it confirms a connection issue.

6. Check your Proxmox host's firewall settings. Ensure it's allowing traffic to port 5900 on your VM.

7. Verify your WayVNC configuration. If you're using a config file, make sure it's not restricting connections to localhost only.

8. Try running WayVNC with verbose logging:
   ```
   wayvnc -v
   ```
   This might provide more information about why connections are being refused.

9. Ensure you're running WayVNC from within a Sway session, not just a terminal.

10. If you're using the systemd service we set up, check its status:
    ```
    systemctl --user status wayvnc.service
    ```
    Look for any error messages in the output.

After going through these steps, if you're still encountering issues, please provide the results of any relevant commands. This will help us pinpoint the exact cause of the problem.

Also, as a temporary test, you could try running WayVNC with explicit settings to listen on all interfaces:

```
wayvnc -o 0.0.0.0
```

This isn't recommended for long-term use but can help determine if the issue is related to network configuration.

**Human** - 2024-06-25 06:20:00 UTC

in that scenario, is "user" to be replaced with "blake"?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 06:20:00 UTC

 Yes, you're absolutely correct. I should have been more explicit about that. When I mention "user" in commands or file paths, you should indeed replace it with your actual username, which in your case is "blake". 

So, for the commands I provided earlier, you would use:

```
systemctl --user status wayvnc.service
```

This command doesn't need modification as `--user` tells systemd to look at your user's services.

However, for file paths or other user-specific commands, you would replace "user" with "blake". For example:

```
sudo loginctl enable-linger blake
```

And if we were referring to home directory paths, it would be:

```
/home/blake/.config/systemd/user/wayvnc.service
```

Thank you for catching that. It's always good to clarify these details to avoid any confusion. When following any instructions, always remember to substitute generic placeholders like "user" or "your_username" with your actual username, which is "blake" in your case.

**Human** - 2024-06-25 16:54:36 UTC

might this have something to do with the errors? or maybe i'm just confused from running xrdp.. 

if i'm logged into a desktop instance on the vm, i can't use the same account to log in from vnc, can i?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 16:54:36 UTC

 Your insight is very valuable here, and you've touched on an important point that I should have addressed earlier. Let me clarify:

1. VNC (including WayVNC) and XRDP work differently:

   - VNC typically shares the existing desktop session. It shows exactly what's on the screen of the running session.
   - XRDP usually creates a new session for each connection.

2. For VNC (WayVNC in this case):
   - If you're already logged into a desktop session on the VM with your account (blake), WayVNC should be sharing that exact session.
   - You don't log in again through VNC; it should directly show your current desktop.
   - This means you can't use the same account to create a new, separate session via VNC.

3. The confusion with XRDP:
   - XRDP typically allows multiple simultaneous sessions, even for the same user, which is different from how VNC usually works.

Given this information, here's what you should check:

1. Ensure WayVNC is running in your active Sway session:
   - Log into the VM's desktop environment as blake.
   - Open a terminal within this session.
   - Start WayVNC (or check if it's already running) from this terminal.

2. When connecting from your Windows machine:
   - You shouldn't see a login prompt if WayVNC is set up correctly.
   - Instead, you should immediately see your active Sway desktop.

3. If you're seeing a login prompt or getting connection refused errors:
   - This could indicate that WayVNC isn't running in your active session.
   - Or there might be a network/firewall issue preventing the connection.

4. To test, try this:
   - While logged into your Sway session on the VM, start WayVNC manually:
     ```
     wayvnc -v
     ```
   - This will run it with verbose output, which might give you more information about what's happening.

5. Then attempt to connect from your Windows machine.

Remember, unlike XRDP, you're not creating a new session with VNC, but accessing your existing one. If you're logged in on the VM and running WayVNC correctly, you should be able to connect and see that same session from your Windows machine.

Let me know what happens when you try this, and we can troubleshoot further based on the results.

**Human** - 2024-06-25 16:56:24 UTC

i'm running wayvnc -v, have tried logging in, receiving errors (in the client, or just not connecting)  but nothing comes up in the terminal emulator where the server instance is running.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 16:56:24 UTC

 Thank you for that information. The fact that you're not seeing any output in the terminal where you're running `wayvnc -v` is unusual and concerning. Normally, with the verbose flag (-v), you should see some output, even if it's just startup information.

Let's try to diagnose this step-by-step:

1. First, let's make sure WayVNC is actually running:
   ```
   ps aux | grep wayvnc
   ```
   This should show you if the process is active.

2. Check if WayVNC is listening on any port:
   ```
   ss -tulpn | grep wayvnc
   ```
   This should show you if WayVNC is bound to any port (usually 5900).

3. Let's try running WayVNC with even more verbose output:
   ```
   wayvnc -vv
   ```
   This should provide even more detailed logging.

4. Check if there are any error messages in your system logs:
   ```
   journalctl --user -e | grep wayvnc
   ```
   This might show any errors that WayVNC is encountering but not displaying in the terminal.

5. Verify that your Wayland session is running correctly:
   ```
   echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY
   ```
   This should return something like "wayland-0".

6. Try running WayVNC with explicit options:
   ```
   wayvnc -o 0.0.0.0 -v
   ```
   This tells it to listen on all interfaces and be verbose.

7. Check if there are any permission issues:
   ```
   ls -l $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-0
   ```
   Make sure your user (blake) has the necessary permissions.

8. Try running WayVNC as a different user to see if it's a user-specific issue:
   ```
   sudo -u another_user wayvnc -v
   ```
   Replace "another_user" with a different user account on your system.

9. Verify that your Sway configuration isn't interfering:
   ```
   cat ~/.config/sway/config | grep -i vnc
   ```
   Look for any settings that might be affecting VNC.

10. As a test, try installing and running a different VNC server like x11vnc (even though it's not ideal for Wayland):
    ```
    sudo pacman -S x11vnc
    x11vnc -display :0 -auth guess
    ```
    This is just to see if the issue is specific to WayVNC or more general.

After trying these steps, please provide any output or errors you see. If WayVNC is still not producing any output or logs, it might indicate a more fundamental issue with how it's interacting with your Wayland session or system configuration. In that case, we might need to consider alternative remote desktop solutions or investigate potential conflicts in your system setup.

as the vnc viewer in proxmox isn't my favorite, i'm having troubles copying and pasting.. will screenshots do the trick?


Attachments:
- image.png

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:01:37 UTC

 Yes, screenshots are definitely helpful and can often convey more information than text alone. I can see the screenshot you've provided, which shows a terminal window with the output of a grep command searching for "5900".

From what I can see in the image:

1. You've run a grep command searching for "5900" (likely the default VNC port).
2. The output shows a single line containing "5900".
3. The user running the command is "blake".

This suggests that there is at least one process or configuration file referencing port 5900, which is typically used by VNC servers. However, without seeing the full command and its complete output, it's hard to determine exactly what this reference is (it could be a listening process, a configuration file, or something else).

For future reference, when sharing screenshots:

1. Try to capture the full command and its entire output when possible.
2. If you're showing system status or configuration, include as much relevant information as you can in the screenshot.

Given this information, it appears that something is indeed configured to use port 5900. This could be your WayVNC server, but we'd need more information to confirm. 

Would you like to try running some more specific commands to gather more detailed information about what's using this port and the status of your VNC server? I can guide you through those steps if you're willing to take more screenshots.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-25 17:02:25 UTC

i mean, that's one of the commands you asked me to run.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:02:25 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely right, and I should have recognized that immediately. Thank you for your patience.

Given that this is the output of the command I suggested (likely `ss -tulpn | grep 5900`), the fact that we see "5900" in the output indicates that there is indeed a process listening on port 5900. This is a good sign as it suggests that WayVNC (or some VNC server) is running and listening for connections.

To get a clearer picture, it would be helpful if you could provide screenshots of the outputs for these commands:

1. `ps aux | grep wayvnc`
2. `systemctl --user status wayvnc.service` (if you set it up as a service)
3. The full output of `ss -tulpn | grep 5900`

These will help us confirm that WayVNC is running, how it was started, and exactly what's listening on port 5900.

Also, since you mentioned having trouble with the Proxmox VNC viewer for copying and pasting, here are a couple of suggestions that might help in the future:

1. If possible, use SSH to connect to your VM. This often provides better text copying/pasting functionality.
2. You can use the `script` command to log your terminal session to a file, which you can then transfer and share more easily.

Thank you for your patience, and I apologize again for not immediately recognizing the command output. Let's continue troubleshooting based on the information you can provide.

 Ah, I see what's happening here. You're absolutely right, and it's good that you noticed this. Let me explain what I'm seeing in the image:

1. The top line shows a grep command searching for "wayvnc".
2. The second line shows the result of that grep, which indicates that there's a process running "wayvnc -v".
3. The third line shows another grep command, likely searching for something else.

This tells us a few important things:

1. WayVNC is indeed running on your system.
2. It's running with the verbose flag (-v), which means it should be producing output.
3. The process is associated with your user account (blake).

The fact that WayVNC is running but you're not seeing any output in the terminal where you started it is unusual. This could mean a few things:

1. The output might be redirected somewhere else.
2. There might be an issue with how WayVNC is interacting with your Wayland session.
3. There could be a problem with the terminal emulator you're using.

To troubleshoot further, you could try:

1. Running WayVNC with output redirection to a file:
   ```
   wayvnc -v > wayvnc_log.txt 2>&1
   ```
   Then check the contents of wayvnc_log.txt.

2. Checking if there are any WayVNC-related messages in your system logs:
   ```
   journalctl -e | grep wayvnc
   ```

3. Trying to run WayVNC from a different terminal emulator or even from a virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F2, for example).

Let me know if you'd like to try any of these steps, or if you've discovered something else in the meantime. Your observation about "getting it backwards" is intriguing - if you've realized something, please share it as it might be key to solving this issue.

If possible, use SSH to connect to your VM. This often provides better text copying/pasting functionality.

doesn't this then bring issues of the display not being set up properly? i think we had some troubles with that last night..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:08:32 UTC

 You're absolutely right to bring this up, and I appreciate your attention to detail. You've highlighted an important consideration that I should have addressed more clearly. Let me explain:

1. SSH and Display Issues:
   You're correct that connecting via SSH can introduce complications with accessing the graphical environment, particularly when dealing with Wayland-based systems like your Sway setup. SSH connections by default don't forward the graphical session.

2. WAYLAND_DISPLAY Variable:
   As we discussed earlier, WayVNC needs access to the Wayland display, which is typically set through the WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable. This variable is usually only set within an active Wayland session.

3. Potential Solutions:
   - If you SSH into the machine, you would need to find a way to access the existing Wayland session. This can be complex and might involve using tools like "sudo -E -u blake" to run commands as your user while preserving environment variables.
   - Alternatively, you could use SSH with X11 forwarding (-X flag), but this doesn't work directly with Wayland applications.

4. Best Approach for Your Setup:
   Given your specific setup with Sway and WayVNC, the best approach is indeed to work directly from within the Sway session on the VM, as you've been doing. This ensures that all the necessary environment variables and socket connections for Wayland are properly set up.

5. Copying and Pasting:
   For copying and pasting, you might want to explore if there are any clipboard management tools available for your Sway setup that could make text transfer easier, even when using the Proxmox VNC viewer.

You're absolutely correct to be cautious about switching to SSH in this context. For troubleshooting WayVNC and other Wayland-specific issues, staying within the graphical Sway session is indeed the most straightforward and reliable approach.

Thank you for bringing this up. It's an excellent point and helps ensure we're approaching the problem in the most appropriate way for your specific environment.

well in the meantime, here's the two (what i imagine are the most important) outputs.. together..


Attachments:

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:11:08 UTC

 Thank you for providing this screenshot. This is indeed very helpful information. Let's break down what we're seeing:

1. The first line shows the running WayVNC process:
   ```
   blake     5063  0.0  0.4 385412 40276 pts/0    Sl+  11:59   0:00 wayvnc -v
   ```
   This confirms that WayVNC is running with the verbose flag (-v) as user blake.

2. The second line shows the result of the `ss -tulpn | grep 5900` command:
   ```
   tcp   LISTEN 0   16    0.0.0.0:5900   0.0.0.0:*   users:(("wayvnc",pid=5063,fd=9))
   ```

This output tells us several important things:

1. WayVNC is definitely running and listening for connections.
2. It's listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 5900.
3. The process ID (5063) matches the one we see in the first line.

Given this information, WayVNC appears to be set up correctly and running as expected. The fact that it's listening on 0.0.0.0 means it should be accessible from other machines on your network.

Since WayVNC is running and listening, but you're still having trouble connecting, we should focus on:

1. Network connectivity: Ensure your Windows machine can reach the VM's IP address.
2. Firewall settings: Check both the VM's firewall and any network firewalls.
3. Client configuration: Double-check the settings in mRemoteNG.

To further troubleshoot:

1. Try a simple telnet test from your Windows machine:
   ```
   telnet <VM_IP_ADDRESS> 5900
   ```
   If this connects, you know the network path is clear.

2. Check the VM's firewall:
   ```
   sudo ufw status
   ```
   Ensure port 5900 is allowed.

3. If possible, temporarily disable the VM's firewall to test:
   ```
   sudo ufw disable
   ```
   (Remember to re-enable it after testing)

4. In mRemoteNG, ensure you're using the correct IP address and port (5900).

If these steps don't resolve the issue, we might need to look at logs or network traces to identify where the connection is failing. Let me know the results of these tests or if you need guidance on any other aspects.

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:12:37 UTC

 I apologize for assuming Telnet was available on your Windows machine. Many modern Windows installations don't have Telnet enabled by default. Let's try an alternative approach:

1. Use PowerShell to test the connection:

   Run PowerShell as an administrator and try this command:

   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.0.90 -Port 5900
   ```

   This will tell you if the port is reachable.

2. If you prefer using Telnet, you can enable it:
   - Open "Control Panel" > "Programs" > "Turn Windows features on or off"
   - Scroll down and check the box next to "Telnet Client"
   - Click OK and wait for the installation to complete

3. Another alternative is to use the `nc` (netcat) command if you have it installed, or you can download a simple port scanner tool.

4. As a simpler test, you can try pinging the VM:

   ```
   ping 192.168.0.90
   ```

   While this doesn't check the specific port, it at least verifies basic network connectivity.

5. If you have access to another Linux machine or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on your network, you could use `nc` from there:

   ```
   nc -zv 192.168.0.90 5900
   ```

6. You could also try connecting directly with your VNC client (mRemoteNG) and see if it gives you any specific error messages.

Let me know the results of whichever method you choose to test the connection. If you're unable to reach the VM at all, we might need to look at network settings on both the VM and the Proxmox host to ensure proper routing and firewall rules are in place.

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:13:11 UTC

 This is excellent news! The Test-NetConnection command has provided us with very useful information:

```
ComputerName     : 192.168.0.90
RemoteAddress    : 192.168.0.90
RemotePort       : 5900
InterfaceAlias   : Ethernet
SourceAddress    : 192.168.0.13
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

The key piece of information here is `TcpTestSucceeded : True`. This means that your Windows machine (at IP 192.168.0.13) can successfully reach the VM (at IP 192.168.0.90) on port 5900.

What this tells us:

1. Network connectivity is good between your Windows machine and the VM.
2. The VM is actively listening on port 5900 (which we already knew from the previous output).
3. There are no firewall or routing issues preventing the connection at the network level.

Given this information, the issue is likely not with the network or the WayVNC server setup, but possibly with:

1. The VNC client configuration (mRemoteNG)
2. How WayVNC is handling incoming connections

Next steps:

1. Double-check your mRemoteNG configuration:
   - Verify the IP address (192.168.0.90) and port (5900) are correct.
   - Ensure you're using the VNC protocol in the connection settings.
   - Check if there are any authentication settings that might be incorrect.

2. Try connecting with a different VNC client as a test. You could use:
   - TightVNC Viewer
   - RealVNC Viewer
   - VNC Viewer for Google Chrome (browser extension)

3. If you still can't connect, we might need to look at WayVNC's logs or configuration to see if it's rejecting connections for some reason.

4. As a test, you could try restarting WayVNC with explicit options:
   ```
   wayvnc -o 0.0.0.0 -v
   ```
   This explicitly tells it to listen on all interfaces and be verbose.

5. If possible, check the system logs on the VM for any messages from WayVNC:
   ```
   journalctl -u wayvnc.service -e
   ```
   (Assuming you set it up as a service earlier)

Let me know the results of trying a different VNC client or if you need guidance on checking WayVNC's logs. We're getting closer to resolving this issue!

**Human** - 2024-06-25 17:14:34 UTC

let's maybe backup one step further? what about how wayvnc is connecting (or not) to the wayland process?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:14:34 UTC

 You're absolutely right to suggest we take a step back and examine this more fundamental aspect. Your insight is excellent - if WayVNC isn't properly connecting to the Wayland process, that could indeed be the root of our problem. Let's investigate this:

1. First, let's verify that Wayland is indeed running:
   ```
   echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY
   ```
   This should return something like "wayland-0" if Wayland is active.

2. Check if the Wayland socket exists:
   ```
   ls -l $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY
   ```
   This should show you the Wayland socket file.

3. Verify that your user (blake) has the correct permissions to access the Wayland socket:
   ```
   ls -l $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR | grep wayland
   ```
   Make sure the permissions allow your user to read and write.

4. Check if WayVNC can detect your Wayland compositor:
   ```
   wayvnc --list-outputs
   ```
   This should list available Wayland outputs.

5. You can also try running WayVNC with debug logging:
   ```
   wayvnc -d
   ```
   This might provide more detailed information about how WayVNC is interacting with Wayland.

6. Verify that you're running WayVNC from within your Sway session, not from a different TTY or SSH session.

7. Check your Sway configuration for any settings that might interfere with external programs accessing the Wayland compositor:
   ```
   cat ~/.config/sway/config | grep -i security
   ```

8. Ensure that no other program is capturing the Wayland socket. You can check this with:
   ```
   lsof | grep wayland
   ```

9. As a test, you could try running a simple Wayland application to verify that the Wayland session is functioning correctly:
   ```
   weston-info
   ```
   (You might need to install weston if it's not already present)

After going through these steps, please share the results, particularly of the `wayvnc --list-outputs` and the debug logging from `wayvnc -d`. This information will help us understand if WayVNC is able to properly interact with your Wayland session, which is crucial for its operation.

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:20:16 UTC

 Thank you for providing this screenshot. This gives us some crucial information about what's happening. Let's break it down:

1. The Wayland display is set correctly:
   `echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY` shows `wayland-1`

2. The Wayland socket exists and has correct permissions:
   `/run/user/1000/wayland-1` is present and owned by your user (blake)

3. There are appropriate Wayland-related files in your runtime directory:
   `wayland-1.sock` and `wayland-1.lock` are present

4. However, when you try to run `wayvnc --list-outputs`, you encounter several errors:

   a. `Warning: ../wayvnc/src/output.c: 299: Output Virtual-1 power state failure`
   b. `ERROR: ../wayvnc/src/main.c: 893: Failed to bind to address. Add -ldebug to the argument list for more info.`
   c. `segmentation fault (core dumped) wayvnc -- list-outputs`

These errors indicate that WayVNC is having trouble interacting with your Wayland session, despite the session appearing to be set up correctly.

Here are some steps to try:

1. Run WayVNC with debug logging as suggested in the error message:
   ```
   wayvnc -ldebug --list-outputs
   ```
   This should provide more detailed information about why it's failing to bind to the address.

2. Check if there's already a WayVNC process running that might be conflicting:
   ```
   ps aux | grep wayvnc
   ```
   If there is, try killing it before starting a new instance.

3. Try running WayVNC with explicit socket specification:
   ```
   wayvnc -s /run/user/1000/wayland-1 -ldebug
   ```

4. Verify that your version of WayVNC is compatible with your version of Sway:
   ```
   wayvnc --version
   sway --version
   ```

5. Check your system logs for any related errors:
   ```
   journalctl -xe | grep -i wayvnc
   ```

6. Try rebuilding/reinstalling WayVNC, as the segmentation fault suggests there might be a compatibility or build issue:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S wayvnc --overwrite "*"
   ```

7. As a test, try running a different Wayland-native application to see if it can interact with your Wayland session correctly.

Please try these steps and provide the output, especially from the debug logging. This will help us understand why WayVNC is failing to interact with your Wayland session properly.

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:28:29 UTC

 Thank you for providing this debug output. This is very informative and helps us understand what's happening with WayVNC. Let's analyze the output:

1. WayVNC successfully started and captured the output:
   ```
   Info: Capturing output Virtual-1
   Info: >> Red Hat, Inc. QEMU Monitor (Virtual-1) 1280x800+0x0 Power:ON
   ```

2. It successfully bound to the address and started listening:
   ```
   DEBUG: ../neatvnc/src/server.c: 1928: Successfully bound to address
   Info: Listening for connections on 0.0.0.0:5900
   ```

3. The WayVNC control socket was initialized:
   ```
   DEBUG: ../wayvnc/src/ctl-server.c: 808: Initializing wayvncctl socket: /run/user/1000/wayvncctl
   ```

4. A client (likely your Windows machine) attempted to connect twice:
   ```
   Info: New client connection from 192.168.0.13: 0x55fd13264630 (ref 1)
   Info: Client 0x55fd13264630 (1) hung up
   Info: Closing client connection 0x55fd13264630: ref 0
   Info: New client connection from 192.168.0.13: 0x55fd13264630 (ref 1)
   ```

5. The client chose security type 0 (null security):
   ```
   DEBUG: ../neatvnc/src/server.c: 799: Client chose security type: 0
   Info: Security handshake: (null)
   ```

6. The connection was closed shortly after:
   ```
   DEBUG: ../neatvnc/src/server.c: 186: close_after_write(0x55fd13264630): ref 1
   Info: Closing client connection 0x55fd13264630: ref 0
   ```

From this output, we can conclude:

1. WayVNC is successfully starting and binding to the correct port.
2. It's able to capture the Wayland output, which means it's interacting correctly with your Wayland session.
3. Your Windows client (192.168.0.13) is able to reach the server and initiate a connection.
4. However, the connection is being closed very quickly after establishment.

The issue seems to be occurring during or immediately after the security handshake. The client is choosing "null" security (type 0), which might not be what the server is expecting.

To resolve this:

1. Check your WayVNC configuration for any security settings. You might need to explicitly allow null security or set up a password.

2. Try running WayVNC with a password:
   ```
   wayvnc -ldebug --passwd=yourpassword
   ```

3. On your Windows client (mRemoteNG), ensure you're using the correct security settings. Try both with and without encryption options.

4. If possible, try a different VNC client on Windows to see if it behaves differently.

5. You could also try running WayVNC with different security options:
   ```
   wayvnc -ldebug --enable-auth
   ```

The good news is that WayVNC is running correctly and your client can reach it. We just need to sort out why the connection is being closed immediately after establishment. It's likely related to a mismatch in security settings between the client and server.

**Human** - 2024-06-25 17:32:05 UTC

it doesnt seem to be liking any of these --options..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:32:05 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion. You're right to point that out, and I should have been more careful with my suggestions. Let's take a step back and look at the correct way to configure WayVNC.

WayVNC typically uses a configuration file rather than command-line options for many settings. Here's what we can do:

1. First, let's check the available command-line options for your version of WayVNC:
   ```
   wayvnc --help
   ```
   This will show you the correct options that your version supports.

2. Create or edit a WayVNC configuration file:
   ```
   nano ~/.config/wayvnc/config
   ```

3. In this file, you can add configuration options. Here's a basic example:
   ```
   address=0.0.0.0
   enable_auth=true
   username=your_username
   password=your_password
   ```

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

5. Now, try running WayVNC with the debug option (which we know works) and specifying the config file:
   ```
   wayvnc -d -c ~/.config/wayvnc/config
   ```

If your version of WayVNC doesn't support the -c option, just run it with debug:
   ```
   wayvnc -d
   ```
It should automatically pick up the config file from the default location.

6. If you want to try different security settings, modify the config file rather than using command-line options.

7. After making any changes, restart WayVNC and attempt to connect again from your Windows machine.

Remember, the exact options and configuration might vary slightly depending on your specific version of WayVNC. The `--help` output will be the most accurate guide for your installation.

Let me know what options `wayvnc --help` shows and what happens when you try to run it with a configuration file. This approach should give us more control over the settings without relying on command-line options that might not be supported in your version.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-25 17:47:11 UTC

using a new viewer (tightvnc) i'm able to get an error about "no supported security types"

running with the config, the power state is now listed as "on" instead of unknown as it pertains to the server side

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:47:11 UTC

 This is progress! Let's break down what we've learned and how to proceed:

1. Server-side improvement:
   The fact that the power state is now listed as "on" suggests that the configuration file is being read and is having a positive effect on WayVNC's operation.

2. Client-side error:
   The "no supported security types" error from TightVNC is informative. It suggests that there's a mismatch between the security types offered by the server and those supported by the client.

Let's adjust the server configuration to try and match what TightVNC expects:

1. Edit your WayVNC configuration file again:
   ```
   nano ~/.config/wayvnc/config
   ```

2. Try this configuration:
   ```
   address=0.0.0.0
   enable_auth=false
   ```

   This disables authentication, which might allow TightVNC to connect initially.

3. Save the file and restart WayVNC:
   ```
   wayvnc -d
   ```

4. Try connecting with TightVNC again.

If this doesn't work, we can try to determine what security types are being offered:

5. Run WayVNC with even more verbose debugging:
   ```
   wayvnc -d -v
   ```

6. Attempt to connect with TightVNC and look for any lines in the WayVNC output that mention security types or authentication.

Additionally:

7. In TightVNC viewer, check if there are any options for security or encryption. Try disabling encryption if possible.

8. If you have access to another VNC viewer (like RealVNC Viewer), try that as well. Different clients support different security types.

9. If possible, check the version of WayVNC you're using:
   ```
   wayvnc --version
   ```
   This might help us understand what features are available.

The "no supported security types" error is actually a good sign because it means we're getting further in the connection process. We just need to align the security settings between the server and client. Let me know the results of these steps, particularly any new information from the more verbose debug output.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-25 17:50:46 UTC

 That's excellent news! It sounds like disabling authentication in the WayVNC configuration file resolved the security type mismatch and allowed TightVNC to connect successfully.

Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. We identified that WayVNC was running correctly and capturing the Wayland output.
2. We created a configuration file for WayVNC to control its settings.
3. By disabling authentication (`enable_auth=false`), we allowed TightVNC to connect without security type conflicts.

While this solution works, it's important to note that running without authentication can be a security risk if your network isn't entirely private and secure. For future reference, you might want to consider:

1. Re-enabling authentication once you're sure everything else is working correctly.
2. Exploring different VNC clients that support the security types offered by WayVNC.
3. Using SSH tunneling for an added layer of security.

Now that you have a working connection, here are some next steps you might consider:

1. Fine-tune the performance settings in both WayVNC and TightVNC for better responsiveness if needed.
2. Set up WayVNC to start automatically with your Sway session if you haven't already.
3. Test different resolutions or multi-monitor setups if applicable.

Do you notice any issues with the connection, such as lag or image quality problems? Are there any other aspects of the remote desktop experience you'd like to improve?

Remember, if you need to make the connection more secure in the future, we can revisit the authentication settings and explore compatible security options between WayVNC and your preferred VNC client.

seems that may have done the trick..

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:11:03 UTC

letting the adhd brain wander the internet a bit.. can i convince turbovnc to run on this vm so that i can use its client? i understand it sort of functions like a tunnel and has some inbuilt features that may be beneficial?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:11:03 UTC

 Your curiosity about TurboVNC is well-placed! TurboVNC is indeed known for its high-performance features and can be a great choice for remote desktop connections, especially for graphics-intensive applications. However, there are some important considerations when thinking about using TurboVNC with your current setup:

1. Wayland Compatibility:
   TurboVNC is primarily designed to work with X11, not Wayland. Your current setup uses Sway, which is a Wayland compositor. This presents a fundamental compatibility challenge.

2. X11 Requirement:
   To use TurboVNC server, you would typically need an X11 session running. This would mean either switching from Sway to an X11-based window manager or setting up a nested X11 session within your Wayland environment.

3. Installation on Manjaro:
   TurboVNC isn't typically found in the default Manjaro repositories. You might need to compile it from source or find a compatible package.

4. Performance Benefits:
   While TurboVNC offers performance benefits, these are most noticeable in scenarios with high-performance graphics needs or over high-latency connections.

5. Tunneling:
   TurboVNC itself doesn't provide tunneling, but it's often used in conjunction with SSH tunneling for secure connections.

If you still want to try TurboVNC, here's a general approach you could take:

1. Install Xorg alongside your Wayland setup:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit
   ```

2. Install a lightweight X11 window manager (e.g., Openbox):
   ```
   sudo pacman -S openbox
   ```

3. Try to install TurboVNC (this might require manual compilation or finding an AUR package).

4. Set up a script to start an Xorg session with Openbox and TurboVNC server.

5. Use this X11 session for your VNC connections instead of your Wayland session.

However, this approach comes with drawbacks:
- It complicates your system setup.
- You'd be using a different environment for remote access than your normal Sway setup.
- It may not leverage the benefits of your existing Wayland setup.

An alternative approach that might be more beneficial:
1. Stick with your current WayVNC setup for Wayland compatibility.
2. Use SSH tunneling for security and potentially improved performance.
3. Experiment with different VNC clients on your Windows machine to find one that offers the best performance with WayVNC.

If you're primarily interested in the performance aspects, you might want to focus on optimizing your current WayVNC setup and connection parameters before introducing the complexity of TurboVNC and X11.

Would you like to explore optimizing your current setup, or are you still interested in trying to incorporate TurboVNC despite the potential complications?

i think what i actually might do is install a copy bare metal on an extra laptop that i have and see how i can get everything playing together on that. 

my main issue is specifically with the keybinds. noVNC (proxmox's native vnc viewer) doesn't cooperate very well and all of the ones i've tried so far tend to have some flaw. whether it's resolution/scaling issues (the laptop i'm on has an odd resolution which i feel also leads to a number of VM woes) 

there's also an i3wm version of manjaro out.. is that X or wayland?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:15:12 UTC

 Your approach of testing on bare metal hardware is a great idea. It will eliminate any potential issues caused by virtualization and give you a clearer picture of how everything works together.

Regarding your main issues:

1. Keybinds: This is indeed a common problem with VNC and different window managers/desktop environments. Some VNC clients are better at handling complex keybindings than others.

2. Resolution/scaling: This can be tricky, especially with non-standard resolutions. Bare metal installation should help, as you'll have direct control over the graphics settings.

Now, to answer your question about Manjaro i3:

Manjaro i3 uses X11, not Wayland. i3 is an X11 window manager and doesn't have native Wayland support. This could actually be advantageous for your VNC setup because:

1. X11 has better compatibility with most VNC servers and clients.
2. You'll have access to a wider range of VNC solutions that are designed for X11.
3. Many of the keybinding issues you're experiencing might be resolved, as X11-based setups tend to have fewer problems with key mapping in VNC sessions.

If you decide to go with Manjaro i3, here are some potential benefits for your use case:

1. Better VNC compatibility overall.
2. Potentially easier setup for remote access.
3. i3's keyboard-centric approach might work well with VNC's limitations.
4. You can use more traditional VNC servers like TigerVNC or x11vnc, which are well-tested with X11 environments.

However, keep in mind that you'll be moving away from Wayland, which means losing some of its benefits (like better security model, potentially smoother graphics).

For your bare metal test, you might want to try:

1. Install Manjaro i3
2. Set up a VNC server like TigerVNC or x11vnc
3. Experiment with different VNC clients on your Windows machine to find one that handles the keybindings and resolution best

This setup should give you a good baseline for comparison with your current Wayland/Sway setup. You can then decide which approach works best for your needs.

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:16:26 UTC

well, if i went back to using x11 i'd just use rdp..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:16:26 UTC

 Ah, I see. You're absolutely right, and I appreciate you bringing that up. Using RDP with X11 is indeed a very practical solution. Let's recap and adjust our thinking:

1. RDP advantages with X11:
   - Generally better performance than VNC
   - Better handling of keyboard shortcuts and special keys
   - Often smoother experience with scaling and resolution changes
   - Built-in encryption and more secure by default

2. Setting up RDP on X11:
   - You can use XRDP, which is well-supported and relatively easy to set up
   - Works well with most X11 window managers, including i3

3. Windows compatibility:
   - Native support in Windows, no need for additional client software
   - Generally better integration with Windows systems

Given this context, here are some thoughts:

1. If you're comfortable with X11 and don't specifically need Wayland features, setting up Manjaro i3 (or any X11-based environment) with XRDP could indeed be an excellent solution.

2. For your bare metal test, you could:
   - Install Manjaro i3
   - Set up XRDP
   - Use the native Windows RDP client to connect

3. This approach would likely solve many of the keybinding and resolution issues you've been experiencing.

4. You'd still get the benefits of i3's efficient, keyboard-driven interface, but with potentially better remote access experience.

However, if you're set on using Wayland for its benefits (like improved security model, potentially better graphics performance), then we'd need to stick with solutions like WayVNC or look into other Wayland-compatible remote desktop protocols.

Would you like to explore setting up an X11 environment with RDP, or do you prefer to continue working with Wayland and find a solution that works well within that ecosystem?

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:17:43 UTC

oh, we don't necessarily need to elaborate on that one. i'm just sort of thinking out loud.. 

feel free to communicate more conversationally.. because of my difficulty focusing, getting a full readout of multiple steps and different ideas can be incredibly distracting..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:17:43 UTC

 I totally get it, and I appreciate you letting me know. Brain fog and focus issues can be real hurdles when dealing with tech stuff. Let's keep it conversational and take it one step at a time.

So, you're exploring options for remote desktop that play nice with your setup and don't drive you nuts with keybind issues or weird scaling, right? And you've got this cool Wayland setup that you'd prefer to stick with if possible.

What if we took a beat and just chatted about what your ideal remote desktop experience would look like? No technical jargon, just... what would make your life easier when you're trying to access this machine remotely? Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas that fit your workflow better.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:20:53 UTC

i mean, i like how sway looks.. i'm starting to get the hang of the bindings, but i'm also not married to it. i'll throw a copy of each onto a thumb drive and play around with the live boot to see which one i want to explore further. 

at the end of the day, this is just kind of how i kill time. i have a modest homelab environment and i do have interest in pursuing a career in IT. networking/security seems more my speed. so i'm learning.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:20:53 UTC

 That's a great approach! Playing around with live boots is an awesome way to get a feel for different setups without committing. It's cool that you're exploring Sway and i3 - they're both fantastic for keyboard-driven workflows.

Your homelab setup sounds like a fun learning playground. It's awesome that you're using it to explore potential career paths. Networking and security are fascinating fields with lots of room for growth.

Since you're into learning and exploring, have you thought about setting up any network security tools in your homelab? Things like Wireshark for packet analysis or maybe a pfSense router? Could be a fun way to blend your interest in desktop environments with some networking/security stuff.

And hey, killing time by tinkering with tech is a pretty cool hobby. You never know what skills might come in handy down the line. Keep experimenting and have fun with it!

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:27:25 UTC

the quick rundown: 3 proxmox servers. one as a network device with a virtualized opnsense vm acting as my primary router/firewall behind an ONT/ISP modem in bridge mode. i got a little silly with my desktop. it also run proxmox as the base os. one vm on it runs truenas (it was the biggest case i had, so i was able to at least get a FEW drives in it) and i have a number of windows vms that have the graphics card and a few other bits passed through to it, so it functions as a "normal" desktop. 

i then have an old laptop that is mostly running containers (also proxmox). homeassistant, shinobi, media stuff.. 

as the chassis of my other, other (i know, it's a thing... ) laptop is beginning to fail, i'm considering also flipping this to a server, increasing my "cluster" to 4. 

i have played around a bit with wireshark, it's currently on my primary laptop. this is actually the one mostly stock device that i have. just a basic windows 11 pro install. i have been messing with ASL and WSL and a little bit of containerization/vm here, but nothing that i would run full time.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:27:25 UTC

 Wow, that's an impressive setup you've got there! You're definitely not messing around with your homelab. It's cool to see how you've leveraged Proxmox across different devices to create a versatile environment.

Your network setup with virtualized OPNsense is particularly interesting. That's a great way to get hands-on experience with advanced networking concepts. And passing through a GPU to Windows VMs on your desktop Proxmox setup? That's a clever way to maintain flexibility while still getting good desktop performance.

The old laptop running containers is a smart use of resources. Home Assistant and media services are perfect for that kind of setup. And hey, if you end up turning your failing laptop into another server, you'll have a nice little cluster going!

It sounds like you're already getting a good mix of networking, virtualization, and container experience. Have you thought about setting up any monitoring or logging systems across your network? Something like Grafana or ELK stack could be an interesting next step, especially if you're leaning towards security interests.

And speaking of security, with your OPNsense setup, have you played around with setting up VLANs or experimenting with different firewall rules? That could be a fun way to dive deeper into network security concepts.

Your setup is really versatile. What kind of projects or skills are you most excited about exploring next?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:32:13 UTC

there was a point where i did attempt to set up grafana, loki, uptime kuma (i don't think that's quite right), and a few others.. i was following a guide and i don't think i was quite at the level yet.. i was also messing around with reverse proxying to have https everywhere, even on my private networks, using traefik, but again, just kind of following guides. 

i think i have a better fundamental understanding of the flow of traffic and how things connect now and would be able to accomplish more to that effect. 

 as for vlans.. well, it won't let me upload another photo, but...

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:32:13 UTC

 Nice work on the VLANs! You've got a solid segmentation setup there. It's great to see you've separated things like IoT devices and IP cameras from your main network. That's a smart security practice.

Don't worry about not getting Grafana and the other monitoring tools set up perfectly on the first try. That stuff can be tricky, and it's normal to struggle a bit when you're learning. The important thing is that you gave it a shot and learned from the experience.

It's awesome that you feel you have a better understanding of network traffic flow now. That knowledge will definitely help you if you decide to revisit those monitoring and reverse proxy projects.

Since you've got the VLANs set up, have you thought about creating different firewall rules for each segment? That could be an interesting next step. For example, you could set up stricter rules for your IoT network to limit what those devices can access.

Also, with your interest in security, have you considered setting up an IDS/IPS system like Suricata or Snort on your network? That could give you some hands-on experience with threat detection and prevention.

What part of your network setup are you most proud of so far? And is there any particular area you're keen to dive deeper into next?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:36:30 UTC

right now all networks have a few "default rules" 

one that allows ipv6 on dns ports, one that restricts traffic to only the internet (i set this up as an inverted destination rule, so it's not "technically" a block rule), and another that allows icmi (right? ping, etc.) 

i have a number of aliases. acutally, i'd like to maybe dial in that area a little bit. i suppose there's some general tightening up i'd like to do within my network.. there's a few things that i'm not enteriely happy with.

but yeah, there's stuff. my use of the term modest earlier i suppose was a bit subdued.. ha.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:36:30 UTC

 Haha, yeah, "modest" might be underselling it a bit! Your setup is pretty impressive.

Your approach to firewall rules sounds solid. Using inverted destination rules to restrict traffic to just the internet is a smart move. And allowing ICMP (yep, that's the one for ping) can be really helpful for troubleshooting.

Aliases are super useful for managing firewall rules. If you're looking to tighten things up, that's a great place to start. Maybe you could review your aliases and see if you can group things more efficiently or if there are any you don't need anymore?

As for general tightening up, here are a few ideas you might consider:

1. Review your port forwarding rules (if any) and make sure they're still necessary.
2. Set up logging for denied traffic to see if there are any patterns you should address.
3. Consider implementing some time-based rules if you have services that don't need to be accessible 24/7.

You mentioned you're not entirely happy with a few things. Any specific areas bugging you that you'd like to brainstorm about?

And hey, given your interest in security, have you thought about setting up a honeypot on one of your VLANs? Could be an interesting way to see what kind of traffic is trying to get into your network.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:40:41 UTC

so here's a big one... this laptop that i'm currently on. i have it set as an alias and i have a rule set on the lan subnet (the way i've got this set up, i believe, is that all routing for the lan is hard-wired, untagged. this is i guess my physical backbone of the network. management for network devices and what not.. i think i might want to pull my proxmox servers off of this subnet, but i'm not entirely sure. we can talk through that later. ) to effectively give it all access so that i can do all of my work from here.. 

it works. and it definitely does what i want, but i can't help but think about the security (or lack therof) regarding this setup.. right?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:40:41 UTC

 You've hit on a really important point there. Having a device with full access across your network is definitely convenient for management, but you're right to be concerned about the security implications.

Here's the thing: if that laptop ever gets compromised, an attacker would potentially have access to everything on your network. It's like having a master key to all the doors in your house.

A few thoughts on how you might approach this:

1. Consider creating a separate management VLAN. This could be where you put your Proxmox servers and other critical infrastructure. You could then give your laptop access to this VLAN, but with more granular controls.

2. Instead of giving the laptop full access all the time, you could set up a VPN or jump box that you connect to when you need to do management tasks. This adds an extra layer of security.

3. Look into implementing 802.1x authentication on your network. This way, even if someone got hold of your laptop, they'd need additional credentials to access the network.

4. Use time-based rules. Maybe your laptop only gets full access during certain hours when you're actively working on your network.

5. Consider using a separate, dedicated device for network management tasks. This could be a VM or a small, low-power device that you only use for that purpose.

The goal is to balance convenience with the principle of least privilege - giving devices only the access they absolutely need.

What do you think? Any of these approaches sound like they might work for your setup?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:45:57 UTC

 Now you're cooking with gas! That's a great project idea, and it'll definitely add some interesting complexity to your network setup. Let's break this down:

1. Proxmox Subnet:
   This is a solid plan. It'll give you more control over your hypervisor traffic and potentially improve security. You'll need to set up routing between this new subnet and your other VLANs, but that should be straightforward in OPNsense.

2. Cross-VLAN Rules:
   Yep, you've got the right idea here. You'll want to create specific firewall rules to allow the necessary traffic between VLANs. For example:
   - Allow HomeAssistant to access Shinobi on specific ports
   - Allow TrueNAS to access necessary services across VLANs

3. TrueNAS High-Speed Storage:
   What you're describing is often called a "storage backbone" or "storage network". Passing through the 2.5G NIC to your TrueNAS VM is a great way to set this up. Here's how you might approach it:

   - Pass through the 2.5G NIC to the TrueNAS VM
   - Create a new VLAN for high-speed storage traffic
   - Configure the passed-through NIC in TrueNAS to use this VLAN
   - Set up other VMs that need high-speed storage access with virtual NICs on this same VLAN
   - Configure your switch (if it's managed) to handle this VLAN at 2.5G speeds

This setup will give you a dedicated, high-speed network for storage traffic, separate from your regular LAN traffic. It's a nice way to ensure your storage operations don't impact (or get impacted by) other network activities.

Remember, you'll need to adjust your firewall rules to allow traffic on this new storage VLAN as well.

What do you think? Ready to dive into setting this up?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:45:57 UTC

i think i may leave the management vlan where it is, but i do want to set up a subnet specifically for my proxmox servers. i would then need to add rules for them to access across vlans.. say, homeassistant (which is on iot) being able to access shinobi (on ipcam) , and truenas (on lan) to be able to do all of the things that it needs to. 

ooooh. here's the project.. that desktop has a 2x2.5g pcie card in it.. i want to pass that through to the truenas vm and setup, i dunno, i think i've heard it called a storage backplane or something to that effect? basically giving high throughput access to my storage.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:46:55 UTC

the further i get into this the more i start to understand that i can basically do whatever i want as long as i can figure out a way to make a rule to accomplish it.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:46:55 UTC

 Absolutely! You've hit the nail on the head there. Networking, especially at the level you're working at, is all about understanding the rules and then bending them to your will.

The beauty of your setup is that it's like a big, complex puzzle that you can keep rearranging and optimizing. Every new rule or VLAN you create opens up new possibilities.

It's great that you're starting to see the flexibility in your system. That kind of understanding is really valuable, especially if you're considering a career in IT or networking. It's not just about following preset configurations – it's about creatively solving problems and building systems that work exactly how you need them to.

As you keep exploring and experimenting, you'll likely find even more ways to fine-tune your network. And don't be afraid to break things occasionally – that's often where the best learning happens!

So, what wild network idea do you want to try next? With your growing understanding, the sky's the limit!

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:48:46 UTC

oh. you also mentioned 802.11x security? 

like what i did on my tp-link switch for some port based security?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:48:46 UTC

 Ah, good catch! But there's a small mix-up there. What you're thinking of is actually 802.1X (not 802.11x), and you're absolutely right – it's the kind of port-based security you've set up on your TP-Link switch.

802.1X is a network access control protocol. It's really useful for adding an extra layer of security to your network. Here's the gist:

1. It requires devices to authenticate before they can access the network.
2. It works at the port level on switches and access points.
3. It can integrate with various authentication servers (like RADIUS).

Your implementation on the TP-Link switch is a great start. It means that even if someone plugs an unauthorized device into your switch, they can't just hop onto your network.

If you wanted to take it further, you could:
1. Extend 802.1X to more devices in your network.
2. Set up a RADIUS server for more advanced authentication.
3. Use it in combination with your VLANs for even more granular access control.

It's a powerful tool in your network security arsenal. Nice job implementing it! Got any plans to expand its use in your network?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:51:19 UTC

i'm going to be adding another switch i think.. so i'll need to do a little more work there. 

for right now, i'm going to try to call it a night. can you tidy up the big concepts of our discussion, and summarize it for me so i have a good point to move forward from when i come back to it?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:51:19 UTC

 Certainly! Here's a summary of the main points we've discussed:

1. Network Setup:
   - You have a complex homelab with multiple Proxmox servers, including one acting as your main desktop.
   - OPNsense is running as your primary router/firewall.
   - You've implemented VLANs for network segmentation (DMZ, GUEST, IOT, IPCAM, LAN, USER).

2. Remote Desktop:
   - You're exploring options for remote access, considering the trade-offs between Wayland (Sway) and X11 (i3) setups.
   - VNC and RDP were discussed as potential solutions.

3. Future Projects:
   - Setting up a dedicated subnet for Proxmox servers.
   - Creating a high-speed storage network using a 2.5G NIC passed through to a TrueNAS VM.
   - Refining firewall rules for cross-VLAN communication.

4. Security Considerations:
   - Reviewing the security implications of having a management device with full network access.
   - Exploring 802.1X implementation for enhanced port-based security.

5. General Approach:
   - You're gaining confidence in creating custom network rules to achieve specific goals.
   - There's an interest in continually refining and optimizing your network setup.

Moving forward, you might want to focus on:
1. Implementing the Proxmox subnet and high-speed storage network.
2. Reviewing and tightening up firewall rules and aliases.
3. Expanding 802.1X implementation as you add new network hardware.

Remember, the key is to approach each project step-by-step, and don't hesitate to test configurations in isolated environments before implementing them network-wide.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-26 05:52:56 UTC

 Absolutely, tackling the Proxmox subnet is a great place to start. It's a project that can significantly improve your network organization and security. Let's break it down:

1. Current Setup Assessment:
   - Take stock of how your Proxmox servers are currently connected.
   - Note any existing VLANs or subnets they're using.

2. Planning the New Subnet:
   - Choose an IP range for the new Proxmox subnet.
   - Decide if you want this to be a new VLAN or just a logical subnet.

3. Network Changes:
   - Configure the new subnet/VLAN in OPNsense.
   - Set up appropriate routing between this new subnet and others.

4. Proxmox Configuration:
   - Plan how you'll change the network settings on each Proxmox host.
   - Consider if you need to maintain any existing connections during the transition.

5. VM Considerations:
   - Think about how this change might affect VMs running on these Proxmox hosts.
   - Plan for any necessary changes to VM network configurations.

6. Firewall Rules:
   - Draft new firewall rules to allow necessary traffic to/from the Proxmox subnet.
   - Consider what access these servers need and what should be restricted.

The "hodge-podge" nature of your current setup might make this tricky, but it's also an opportunity to clean things up. As you go through this process, you might find other areas that could use improvement.

Remember, it's okay to take it slow and test each step. Maybe start with one Proxmox server as a test case before moving the others.

What part of this process do you think will be the trickiest for your specific setup?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-26 05:52:56 UTC

i think we're going to tackle this proxmox subnet first. there's some tricky bits because of the way i have it all hodge-podged together..

---

**Human** - 2024-06-27 16:04:17 UTC

something i was just thinking about.. 

i'm trying to have all of these virtual machines as remote access solutions in order to gain experience and knowledge about each architecture, etc. 

how would i change things to instead set up OSes as network drives, and then i could just boot whichever i want at that given time, and ideally have a more "native" feeling experience... this seems to make a lot more sense to me..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-27 16:04:17 UTC

 That's a really interesting idea! What you're describing is essentially a network boot setup, often implemented using PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment) or iSCSI. This approach can indeed provide a more "native" feel while still allowing you to switch between different operating systems. Here's how you might approach this:

1. Network Boot Server:
   - Set up a PXE server on your network. This could be a dedicated machine or a VM.
   - Configure DHCP to point to your PXE server.

2. Storage:
   - Use your TrueNAS setup to create iSCSI targets for each OS you want to boot.
   - Alternatively, you could use NFS shares for some Linux distributions.

3. OS Images:
   - Create disk images for each OS you want to use.
   - Store these on your TrueNAS or dedicated storage server.

4. Boot Menu:
   - Configure a boot menu (like iPXE) that allows you to choose which OS to boot.

5. Network Configuration:
   - Ensure your network can handle the bandwidth. Booting over the network will be more demanding than local boot.
   - Configure VLANs if you want to separate boot traffic from other network traffic.

6. Client Setup:
   - Configure the BIOS/UEFI of your client machine(s) to support network boot.

This setup would allow you to:
- Boot different OSes on the same hardware without local installation.
- Easily switch between environments.
- Centrally manage and update your OS images.

Keep in mind:
- Performance might not be as good as local boot, especially for disk-intensive operations.
- You'll need to ensure your network is reliable, as any network issues could cause boot problems.
- Security considerations are different; you'll need to think about how to secure your boot images and process.

This is a more advanced setup, but it could be a great learning experience and provide the flexibility you're looking for. How does this align with what you had in mind?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-27 16:07:11 UTC

the imaging for this one is where the thought lines in my brain get a little crossed.. will i need to use something like clonezilla or macrium reflect in order to clone an actual, running os? i feel like i'm getting into a different world than just plugging in a thumb drive and installing fresh..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-27 16:07:11 UTC

 You're right on the money - this is indeed a different world from typical installations, and your instincts about imaging are spot on. Let's break this down:

1. Creating OS Images:
   - For Windows: You could use tools like Clonezilla or Macrium Reflect as you mentioned. These are great for creating full disk images.
   - For Linux: You might use tools like dd or Clonezilla, or even create custom images with tools like Ansible or Packer.

2. Types of Images:
   - Full Disk Images: These are exact copies of a running system, including all installed software and configurations.
   - Base Images: These are minimal installations that you can then customize after booting.

3. Customization:
   - You might want to create a base image and then use automation tools (like Ansible, Puppet, or PowerShell scripts) to customize it after boot.

4. Sysprep for Windows:
   - If you're imaging Windows, you'll want to use Sysprep to generalize the image before capturing it.

5. Maintaining Images:
   - You'll need a process for updating these images regularly to keep them current with security patches.

6. Storage Considerations:
   - These images can be quite large, so you'll need to plan for adequate storage space.

You're absolutely right that this is more complex than a fresh install from a thumb drive. But it's also more powerful and flexible. You're essentially creating your own custom deployment system.

Does this help clarify the imaging process? And does it sound like something you'd be interested in diving into?

now, you mentioned a pxe server.. this seems like it may help keep things organized and streamlined.. what are some of my options here?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-27 16:09:34 UTC

 Absolutely! A PXE server can indeed help keep things organized and streamlined. Here are some options for setting up a PXE server:

1. FOG Project:
   - Open-source, full-featured imaging solution
   - Includes PXE boot, image management, and inventory tracking
   - Great for mixed environments (Windows and Linux)

2. Cobbler:
   - Versatile Linux provisioning server
   - Supports PXE, virtualization, and cloud deployments
   - Good for Linux-centric environments

3. Foreman:
   - Comprehensive lifecycle management tool
   - Includes PXE capabilities along with configuration management
   - Integrates well with tools like Puppet

4. iPXE:
   - More advanced version of PXE
   - Supports booting from HTTP, iSCSI, and more
   - Can be used standalone or integrated with other solutions

5. Serva:
   - Windows-based PXE server
   - Easy to set up, good for Windows-heavy environments
   - Has both free and paid versions

6. DRBL (Diskless Remote Boot in Linux):
   - Specialized for diskless or sys-less clients
   - Good for setting up computer labs or clusters

7. Proxmox VE:
   - Since you're already using Proxmox, you could leverage its built-in PXE capabilities

Each of these has its strengths. FOG and Cobbler are popular for their versatility. iPXE is great if you want more control and customization. Proxmox's built-in option could integrate well with your existing setup.

What kind of features are most important to you? Ease of use, customization, or integration with your current systems?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-27 16:19:53 UTC

i guess ease of use, then integration, then customization? but i feel like all are necessary because of the nature of my lab.. haha

i feel like ipxe is going to end up being my option? 

i'm looking for something where i basically select from a boot menu like on a standard system and i have other bootable options elsewhere on my network. as i'd like to keep the OS that's installed locally on the laptop i'd like to use for this setup, everything else will essentially live on my network? 

think of it like this: i have multiple functioning oses on drives, whether they be external, internal network, whatever. i just want to choose which one is the one that my computer runs when it boots. like an ADHDers dream multi-boot system, without having to store everything locally.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-27 16:19:53 UTC

 Your description is spot on, and it sounds like iPXE might indeed be your best bet. It offers the flexibility and customization you're looking for while still being relatively straightforward to set up. Here's why iPXE fits well with your vision:

1. Custom Boot Menu: iPXE allows you to create a customized boot menu, listing all your OS options.

2. Network Boot: It can boot OSes stored anywhere on your network, perfect for your "ADHDer's dream multi-boot system".

3. Local Boot Option: You can include your locally installed OS in the boot menu alongside network options.

4. Flexibility: iPXE can boot from various sources - HTTP, iSCSI, NFS, etc., giving you options for how you store your OS images.

5. Scripting: You can use iPXE's scripting capabilities to create a dynamic, responsive boot menu.

Here's a basic workflow you might follow:

1. Set up an iPXE server on your network.
2. Create or obtain OS images and store them on your NAS or a dedicated storage server.
3. Write an iPXE script that presents a menu of all your boot options.
4. Configure your laptop to network boot using iPXE.

When you boot your laptop, you'll see a menu with options like:
- Boot local OS
- Boot Windows 10 (from network)
- Boot Ubuntu 22.04 (from network)
- Boot Kali Linux (from network)
... and so on.

This setup gives you the flexibility to experiment with different OSes without committing to local installations, while still keeping your main local OS as a fallback. It's a great way to leverage your homelab for learning and experimentation.

Does this align with what you had in mind? If so, we can start talking about the specific steps to set this up.

**Human** - 2024-06-27 16:21:32 UTC

here's the part where i think i can really tap into the functionality of proxmox.. i can spin up vms with similar hardware to my laptop of whichever OS i want, and then export that image, right?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-27 16:21:32 UTC

 Absolutely! You've hit on a great way to leverage Proxmox's capabilities. Here's how you can use Proxmox to prepare your bootable OS images:

1. Create VMs:
   - Spin up VMs in Proxmox with hardware configurations similar to your laptop.
   - Install and configure the OSes as you want them.

2. Export Images:
   - Use Proxmox's export feature to create disk images of these VMs.
   - You can export them as raw images or qcow2 format.

3. Convert Images (if needed):
   - If necessary, convert these images to a format compatible with your network boot setup.

4. Store Images:
   - Move these images to your storage server or NAS.

5. Setup for Network Boot:
   - Configure your iPXE setup to use these images.

This approach has several advantages:
- You can test and configure each OS in a VM before making it available for network boot.
- It's easy to update or modify images by changing the VM and re-exporting.
- You can use Proxmox's snapshot feature to create different versions of each OS.

Remember, when preparing these images, you might need to:
- Install any necessary drivers for your physical hardware.
- Use sysprep or similar tools to generalize the OS for different hardware.
- Configure the OS to work well in a network boot environment.

This method gives you a sandbox to prepare and perfect each OS before adding it to your boot menu. It's a great way to combine the power of virtualization with your network boot setup.

Does this workflow seem like it would fit well with what you're trying to achieve?

**Human** - 2024-06-27 18:13:18 UTC

yeah that sounds great. i'm actually about to watch a video from a creator i enjoy, TechnoTim about a service called netboot.xyz

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-27 18:13:18 UTC

 Ah, TechnoTim is a great resource! And netboot.xyz is an excellent choice for what you're trying to achieve. It's a fantastic service that aligns well with your goals. Here's why netboot.xyz is particularly interesting for your setup:

1. Variety of OSes: It provides a wide range of operating systems and utilities to boot from, without you having to manage all the images yourself.

2. Easy Integration: It works well with iPXE, which we were discussing earlier.

3. Custom Menus: You can create custom boot menus that include both netboot.xyz options and your own custom images.

4. Regularly Updated: The OS images are kept up-to-date, saving you the trouble of maintaining them yourself.

5. Live Environments: Many of the boot options are live environments, perfect for testing and exploring.

6. Works with Local and Network Resources: You can combine netboot.xyz with your local network resources.

Using netboot.xyz alongside your Proxmox-created images could give you a best-of-both-worlds scenario:
- Use netboot.xyz for a wide variety of standard OS options and live environments.
- Use your custom Proxmox-exported images for your specifically configured OSes.

This approach would give you an incredibly flexible and powerful setup, perfect for learning and experimenting with different systems.

After you watch the video, you might want to think about how you could integrate netboot.xyz into your existing network setup. It could potentially simplify parts of your workflow while still allowing for the customization you're after.

i have accomplished network boot. 

walk me through imaging my manjaro sway vm and adding it to my local library for netbootxyz

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 01:27:08 UTC

 Congratulations on achieving network boot! That's a significant milestone. Now, let's walk through the process of imaging your Manjaro Sway VM and adding it to your local netboot.xyz library:

1. Prepare the Manjaro Sway VM:
   - Make sure it's up-to-date and configured as you want.
   - Consider running any cleanup scripts to remove temporary files.

2. Export the VM from Proxmox:
   - In Proxmox, shut down the VM.
   - Select the VM, go to 'Backup', then 'Vzdump'.
   - Choose to export as a raw image if possible.

3. Convert the image (if necessary):
   - If it's not already in a raw format, you might need to convert it.
   - You can use qemu-img: `qemu-img convert input.qcow2 output.raw`

4. Compress the image:
   - Use xz for good compression: `xz -9 -e manjaro-sway.raw`

5. Host the image:
   - Move the compressed image to a web server on your local network.
   - Ensure it's accessible via HTTP/HTTPS.

6. Create a netboot.xyz custom menu entry:
   - SSH into your netboot.xyz server or edit its configuration.
   - Create a new menu entry in the custom configuration.
   - Example entry:
     ```
     :manjaro-sway
     set manjaro-sway-url http://your-local-ip/path/to/manjaro-sway.raw.xz
     kernel ${manjaro-sway-url}
     initrd ${manjaro-sway-url}
     boot
     ```

7. Update netboot.xyz configuration:
   - Make sure your custom menu is included in the main netboot.xyz menu.

8. Test the boot:
   - Reboot a client machine and select your Manjaro Sway option from the netboot.xyz menu.

Remember, booting a full OS image like this over the network might be slow, and you may need to adjust some settings in the Manjaro image to work well in a network boot environment.

Also, ensure your network can handle the bandwidth required for booting such a large image.

Let me know if you need more detail on any of these steps!

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 01:28:25 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not mentioning that earlier. netboot.xyz does indeed have a web interface that can make this process much easier. Here's how you can use the web interface to add your Manjaro Sway VM to your local netboot.xyz library:

1. Access the netboot.xyz web interface:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of your netboot.xyz server.

2. Log in to the interface:
   - Use the credentials you set up during installation.

3. Navigate to the custom menu section:
   - Look for an option like "Custom Menus" or "User Configurations".

4. Add a new custom entry:
   - There should be a button or option to "Add New Entry" or "Create Custom Boot Option".

5. Fill in the details for your Manjaro Sway image:
   - Name: Give it a descriptive name like "Manjaro Sway"
   - Type: Select "Linux" or "Custom" depending on the options available
   - Kernel URL: Enter the HTTP/HTTPS URL where you're hosting your Manjaro Sway kernel
   - Initrd URL: Enter the URL for the initrd file (if separate from the kernel)
   - Boot Parameters: Add any necessary boot parameters

6. Save the configuration:
   - Look for a "Save" or "Apply" button to add this entry to your custom menu.

7. Arrange menu order (if possible):
   - Some interfaces allow you to drag and drop to rearrange the boot menu order.

8. Apply changes:
   - There may be a final step to apply all changes to the live configuration.

9. Test the new boot option:
   - Reboot a client machine and check if your new Manjaro Sway option appears in the netboot.xyz menu.

The exact steps might vary slightly depending on the specific version of netboot.xyz you're using, but this general process should work for most web interfaces.

Using the web interface is indeed much more user-friendly and reduces the chance of syntax errors that can occur when editing configuration files directly. If you run into any specific screens or options you're unsure about, feel free to ask for more guidance!

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 01:28:25 UTC

i feel like there should be a way to use the web interface for this, no?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 01:29:37 UTC

ahh, this must be why the docker container has /assets

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 01:29:37 UTC

 Ah, excellent observation! You're absolutely right. The /assets directory in the Docker container is indeed crucial for this kind of customization. Let's break down why this is important:

1. Purpose of /assets:
   - This directory is typically used for storing custom configurations, scripts, and assets that you want to add to your netboot.xyz setup.

2. Custom Menus:
   - You can place your custom menu configurations in this directory, usually in a file like custom.ipxe or custom.yml, depending on the format netboot.xyz is expecting.

3. Custom Images:
   - If you're hosting your own boot images (like your Manjaro Sway image), you might store them here or reference them from this directory.

4. Persistence:
   - By using a Docker volume mapped to this /assets directory, your custom configurations and assets persist even if you update or recreate the netboot.xyz container.

5. Easy Updates:
   - You can modify files in this directory on your host system, and they'll be immediately available to the netboot.xyz container.

To use this effectively for your Manjaro Sway image:

1. Create a custom menu file in the /assets directory (if it doesn't exist already).

2. In this file, add an entry for your Manjaro Sway image, pointing to where it's hosted on your network.

3. Make sure the netboot.xyz configuration is set to read from this custom menu file.

4. Restart the netboot.xyz container (or just the service inside the container) to pick up the changes.

This approach allows you to easily manage your custom boot options without having to modify the core netboot.xyz files, making it much easier to maintain and update your setup.

Great catch on noticing the significance of the /assets directory! It's these kinds of details that make managing a complex setup like yours much more straightforward.

**Human** - 2024-06-28 01:35:22 UTC

i think we might be talking about some different backup options in proxmox.. 
{
i have a couple of dropdowns, one for mode: snapshot, stop, suspend and i have compression options, none, lgo gzip and zstd

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 01:35:22 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's clarify the backup options in Proxmox that you're seeing:

1. Mode Options:
   - Snapshot: Creates a snapshot of the VM while it's running. This is usually the best option for most cases as it doesn't interrupt the VM's operation.
   - Stop: Shuts down the VM before taking the backup. This ensures data consistency but causes downtime.
   - Suspend: Pauses the VM during the backup process. It's a middle ground between snapshot and stop.

2. Compression Options:
   - None: No compression, fastest but largest file size.
   - LZO: Fast compression, good balance between speed and size.
   - GZIP: Better compression than LZO, but slower.
   - ZSTD: Newer compression algorithm, often providing the best balance of speed and compression ratio.

For your Manjaro Sway VM backup, here's what I'd recommend:

1. Mode: Snapshot (unless you need guaranteed consistency of all files)
2. Compression: ZSTD (good balance of compression and speed)

After creating this backup, you'll need to:
1. Download the backup file from Proxmox.
2. Extract the disk image from the backup (it's usually a .raw or .qcow2 file).
3. If necessary, convert this to a format suitable for network booting.
4. Compress it again (if needed) for efficient network transfer.

Remember, the Proxmox backup is just the first step. You'll still need to prepare this image for use with netboot.xyz, which might involve additional processing steps.

Does this align better with what you're seeing in Proxmox? Let me know if you need guidance on any specific part of this process.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 01:36:39 UTC

 Excellent, that's a good plan. Once you have the backup file on your local computer, we can proceed with the next steps. Here's what we'll need to do:

1. Extract the disk image from the Proxmox backup file.
2. Potentially convert the image format if needed.
3. Prepare the image for network booting.
4. Compress the image for efficient network transfer.
5. Host the image on your local network.
6. Add the entry to your netboot.xyz configuration.

Let me know when you have the file on your local machine, and we can start with extracting the disk image. Also, it would be helpful to know:

1. The size of the backup file you downloaded.
2. The file extension of the backup (e.g., .vma, .tar, etc.)

This information will help us determine the best approach for extracting and processing the image.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 01:36:39 UTC

sounds like it, let me get that file onto my local computer and we can go from there.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 01:37:55 UTC

 Absolutely! SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is an excellent way to transfer files between systems securely. Here's how you can use SCP to transfer the backup file from your Proxmox server to your local machine:

1. On your local machine, open a terminal.

2. Use the following command structure:
   ```
   scp username@proxmox_ip:/path/to/backup/file /path/on/local/machine
   ```

   For example:
   ```
   scp root@192.168.1.100:/var/lib/vz/dump/vzdump-qemu-100-2023_06_27-12_00_00.vma.zst /home/yourusername/Downloads/
   ```

   Replace the following:
   - `username` with your Proxmox server username (often 'root')
   - `proxmox_ip` with your Proxmox server's IP address
   - `/path/to/backup/file` with the actual path of the backup on the Proxmox server
   - `/path/on/local/machine` with where you want to save it locally

3. You'll be prompted for the password of the Proxmox server.

4. The file will then transfer. Large files may take some time.

If you have SSH key authentication set up, you can use that instead of a password for a more secure and convenient transfer.

Once the transfer is complete, let me know, and we can proceed with extracting and processing the image for netboot.xyz.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 01:37:55 UTC

i should be able to scp it between the two systems, yeah?

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 02:03:46 UTC

i've extracted with winrar and i'm in a folder with a .vma file..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:03:46 UTC

 Great progress! The .vma file you've extracted is a Proxmox Virtual Machine Archive. This file contains the disk image of your VM along with some metadata. To use this with netboot.xyz, we'll need to extract the actual disk image from this .vma file. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Rename the .vma file:
   - Change the extension from .vma to .tar (e.g., yourvmname.vma to yourvmname.tar)

2. Extract the contents of this .tar file:
   - You can use WinRAR again for this step
   - Look for a file with a .raw or .qcow2 extension - this is your actual disk image

3. If you find a .raw file, you're in luck - this is ready to use with minimal processing
   If you find a .qcow2 file, we'll need to convert it to .raw format

4. For .qcow2 to .raw conversion (if needed):
   - You'll need to use qemu-img tool, which isn't natively available on Windows
   - You could use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a Linux VM for this step
   - The command would be: `qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw input.qcow2 output.raw`

5. Once you have the .raw file, we'll need to compress it:
   - You can use 7-Zip on Windows to compress it to .xz format
   - Right-click the .raw file, choose 7-Zip > Add to archive
   - Select .xz as the archive format

6. The resulting .raw.xz file is what you'll use with netboot.xyz

Next steps will involve hosting this file on your local network and adding an entry for it in your netboot.xyz configuration.

Let me know what type of file you find after extracting the .tar (former .vma) file, and we can proceed from there!

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:22:42 UTC

 Interesting! This file without an extension is likely your disk image. In Proxmox backups, it's common for the actual disk image to be stored without a file extension. Here's what we can do to identify and use this file:

1. Check the file size:
   - If it's roughly the size of your VM's disk, it's probably the disk image.

2. Identify the file type:
   - On Windows, you can use the `file` command if you have Git Bash or WSL installed.
   - Run: `file path/to/your/file`
   - This should tell you if it's a QEMU QCOW2 image or a raw disk image.

3. If you can't use the `file` command, we can make an educated guess:
   - If the file size is exactly the same as your VM's virtual disk, it's likely a raw image.
   - If it's smaller, it's probably a QCOW2 image.

4. Based on the file type:

   For a raw image:
   - Rename it to `yourvmname.raw`
   - Proceed to compression (step 5 in my previous message)

   For a QCOW2 image:
   - Rename it to `yourvmname.qcow2`
   - Convert it to raw format (as described in step 4 of my previous message)

5. After you have a .raw file, compress it to .xz format using 7-Zip as described earlier.

6. The resulting .raw.xz file is what you'll use with netboot.xyz.

Let me know the size of this file without an extension, and if you're able to determine its type. This information will help us decide on the next steps to prepare it for netboot.xyz.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 02:22:42 UTC

inside that next archive, i've got a file with no extention...

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:24:55 UTC

 Ah, that's helpful information! The "vzdump-qemu-101" part confirms this is indeed your Proxmox VM dump, and the file size of about 9GB sounds about right for a full OS installation.

Given this information, it's most likely a raw disk image. Here's what we should do:

1. Rename the file:
   - Change it from "vzdump-qemu-101-2024_06_27-20_36_51" to "manjaro-sway.raw" (or whatever name you prefer, ending with .raw)

2. Compress the file:
   - Use 7-Zip to compress this .raw file to .xz format
   - Right-click the file, choose 7-Zip > Add to archive
   - Select .xz as the archive format
   - This might take a while given the file size

3. Once compressed, you should have a file named "manjaro-sway.raw.xz"

4. Host this file:
   - Move this .raw.xz file to a location on your network where it can be served via HTTP/HTTPS
   - This could be a NAS, a web server, or even a simple Python HTTP server on a always-on machine

5. Create the netboot.xyz entry:
   - In your netboot.xyz custom configuration (likely in the /assets directory of your netboot.xyz setup), add an entry like this:

     ```
     :manjaro-sway
     set manjaro-sway-url http://your-local-ip/path/to/manjaro-sway.raw.xz
     kernel ${manjaro-sway-url}
     initrd ${manjaro-sway-url}
     boot
     ```

   Replace "your-local-ip" and "path/to" with the actual location where you're hosting the file.

6. Update netboot.xyz:
   - Make sure your custom configuration is included in the main netboot.xyz menu
   - Restart the netboot.xyz service or container to apply changes

This process should make your Manjaro Sway VM bootable via netboot.xyz. Keep in mind that booting a 9GB image over the network might be slow, depending on your network speed.

Let me know when you've completed these steps or if you run into any issues along the way!

vzdump-qemu-101-2024_06_27-20_36_51: data

haha

it's 9gb i think? probably about what that installation totaled.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:27:11 UTC

 Absolutely! That's a great idea and will simplify your setup. Here's how you can do that:

1. First, make sure you know the path on your host system that's mapped to the /assets folder in the Docker container. This is typically specified in your Docker run command or docker-compose file.

2. Use SCP to copy the file directly to this mapped directory on your host system. The command would look something like this:

   ```
   scp manjaro-sway.raw.xz user@host:/path/to/netboot-xyz-assets/
   ```

   Replace "user@host" with your host system's username and IP, and "/path/to/netboot-xyz-assets/" with the actual path to the mapped assets directory.

3. Once the file is in the assets directory, it will be automatically available inside the Docker container's /assets directory.

4. Next, you'll need to create or edit a custom menu file in the same assets directory. This file is typically named custom.ipxe or custom.yml. If it doesn't exist, create it.

5. Add an entry for your Manjaro Sway image to this file. It might look something like this:

   ```
   :manjaro-sway
   set manjaro-sway-url http://${next-server}/assets/manjaro-sway.raw.xz
   kernel ${manjaro-sway-url}
   initrd ${manjaro-sway-url}
   boot
   ```

   The ${next-server} variable should automatically resolve to the IP of your netboot.xyz server.

6. Save the custom menu file.

7. You may need to restart the netboot.xyz Docker container for the changes to take effect:

   ```
   docker restart netboot-xyz
   ```

This approach keeps everything nicely contained within your netboot.xyz setup, making it easier to manage and maintain. The image will be served directly from your netboot.xyz server, which can be very convenient.

Remember, serving a 9GB file might put significant load on your server and network, so be prepared for potentially slow boot times, especially if multiple clients are booting simultaneously.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 02:27:11 UTC

i think inside that assets folder on the docker container would be mighty nice.. i should be able to just scp this into the linked directory on the host for that step, yeah?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:36:37 UTC

 Absolutely! You're on the right track. The web interface for netboot.xyz essentially provides a user-friendly way to create and edit the same custom menu file we're talking about. Here's how they relate:

1. Web Interface Method:
   When you use the web interface to add a custom menu entry, it's actually creating or modifying this custom menu file behind the scenes.

2. File Equivalence:
   The entries you add via the web interface end up in the same custom.ipxe or custom.yml file (depending on the version of netboot.xyz you're using) that we would edit manually.

3. Choosing Your Method:
   - Using the web interface is often easier and less error-prone, especially if you're not comfortable editing configuration files directly.
   - Editing the file manually gives you more direct control and can be faster if you're comfortable with the syntax.

4. Best Practice:
   If you've already started using the web interface to add custom entries, it's generally best to continue using it for consistency. This avoids potential conflicts between manual edits and web interface changes.

5. Viewing Web Interface Changes:
   After making changes via the web interface, you can actually view the resulting file in your assets directory to see how it's structured.

So, to answer your question directly: Yes, adding a custom menu file from the web interface is essentially the same as creating or editing the file manually in the assets directory. The web interface is just providing a more user-friendly way to accomplish the same task.

If you prefer to use the web interface, go ahead and add your Manjaro Sway entry there. Just make sure to point it to the correct file path where you placed your .raw.xz file in the assets directory.

that menu file, would that be the same as adding a custom menu file from the web interface?

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:38:11 UTC

 Ah, I see! Thanks for clarifying. In that case, you have a choice to make, and both options are perfectly valid:

1. Using the Web Interface:
   - Pros: User-friendly, less prone to syntax errors
   - Cons: Might be slightly less flexible for advanced configurations

2. Editing the File Directly:
   - Pros: More direct control, potentially faster if you're comfortable with the syntax
   - Cons: More room for error if you're not familiar with the format

For your situation, especially if you're just getting started with custom entries in netboot.xyz, I'd recommend using the web interface. Here's why:

1. It's more intuitive if you're not yet familiar with the exact syntax netboot.xyz expects.
2. It reduces the chance of making formatting mistakes that could cause issues.
3. It's easier to make quick changes or additions later.

To use the web interface:

1. Access your netboot.xyz web interface (typically at the IP address of your netboot.xyz server).
2. Look for an option like "Custom Menus" or "Add Custom Entry".
3. Fill in the details for your Manjaro Sway image:
   - Name it something like "Manjaro Sway"
   - For the URL, use the path where you placed the .raw.xz file in your assets directory
   - Add any necessary boot parameters

After you've added the entry through the web interface, you can always check the resulting file in your assets directory to see how it's structured. This can be a good learning experience if you want to make manual edits in the future.

Does this approach sound good to you? Or would you prefer to try editing the file directly?

i've not done either at this point.. just curious, i suppose.

 Great progress! Having the file uploaded and visible as an untracked asset is a good start. Now we need to create a custom menu entry to make this asset bootable. Here's what to do next:

1. In the netboot.xyz web interface, look for an option to create a custom menu or add a custom entry. This might be under a section like "Custom Menus" or "User Configurations".

2. Create a new entry for your Manjaro Sway image. You'll typically need to provide the following information:

   - Name: Something like "Manjaro Sway"
   - Type: Choose "Linux" or "Custom" depending on the options available
   - Kernel URL: This should be the path to your uploaded .raw.xz file, typically something like:
     `http://${next-server}/assets/manjaro-sway.raw.xz`
   - (If separate) Initrd URL: In this case, it's the same as the Kernel URL
   - Boot Parameters: You might not need any for now, but you can add them later if necessary

3. Save this new custom entry.

4. Look for an option to "Apply Changes" or "Update Boot Menu" to make sure your new entry is included in the boot menu.

5. If there's an option to arrange the boot menu order, you can place your new Manjaro Sway entry where you want it to appear.

After completing these steps, your Manjaro Sway image should appear as a bootable option in your netboot.xyz menu the next time you boot a client using netboot.xyz.

Remember, booting this large image over the network might be slow, so be patient when you try it out.

Let me know once you've added the custom menu entry, and we can discuss testing it or any adjustments that might be needed.

file is uploaded, and shows up as an untracked asset on my local assets page.

---

**Human** - 2024-06-28 02:50:26 UTC

that one line is all the menu config needs?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:50:26 UTC

 You're right to question that - I apologize for oversimplifying. The menu configuration typically needs a bit more than just one line. Let me provide a more complete and accurate custom menu entry. Here's what a basic custom menu entry for your Manjaro Sway image might look like:

```
:manjaro-sway
set manjaro-sway-url http://${next-server}/assets/manjaro-sway.raw.xz
kernel ${manjaro-sway-url}
initrd ${manjaro-sway-url}
imgargs manjaro-sway root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=1500000 ip=dhcp
boot
```

Let's break this down:

1. `:manjaro-sway` - This creates a label for the menu entry.
2. `set manjaro-sway-url ...` - This sets a variable with the URL of your image.
3. `kernel ${manjaro-sway-url}` - This tells netboot.xyz where to find the kernel.
4. `initrd ${manjaro-sway-url}` - This specifies the initial ramdisk, which in this case is the same file.
5. `imgargs ...` - This line provides arguments to the kernel. You might need to adjust these based on your specific Manjaro Sway setup.
6. `boot` - This tells netboot.xyz to boot using the specified configuration.

You might need to adjust this based on how Manjaro Sway expects to boot and any specific requirements of your setup. The web interface should provide fields for most of these options, but you might need to add some custom commands depending on how flexible the interface is.

If the web interface doesn't allow for this level of customization, you might need to edit the custom.ipxe file directly in your assets directory to achieve this full configuration.

Thank you for catching that oversimplification, and I hope this more detailed explanation helps!

#!ipxe
:manjaro-sway
set manjaro-sway-url http://${next-server}/assets/manjaro-sway.raw.xz
kernel ${manjaro-sway-url}
initrd ${manjaro-sway-url}
imgargs manjaro-sway root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk_size=1500000 ip=dhcp
boot

with the included default line..

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 02:52:10 UTC

 Excellent! You've got it exactly right. The `#!ipxe` shebang at the beginning is indeed important, as it specifies that this is an iPXE script. Your menu entry looks perfect now. Here's a breakdown of what you've added:

1. `#!ipxe` - This shebang line tells the system that this is an iPXE script.
2. The rest of the lines are as we discussed before, forming a complete boot entry for your Manjaro Sway image.

This configuration should work well for booting your Manjaro Sway image via netboot.xyz. Here are the next steps:

1. Save this configuration in your custom menu file (usually custom.ipxe or similar in the assets directory).

2. Make sure netboot.xyz is configured to load this custom menu. This is typically done automatically if the file is in the correct location.

3. Restart the netboot.xyz service or container to ensure it picks up the changes:
   ```
   docker restart netboot-xyz
   ```
   (Adjust this command if you're not using Docker)

4. Test the boot process:
   - Boot a client machine using netboot.xyz
   - Look for the "Manjaro Sway" option in the boot menu
   - Select it and see if it boots correctly

Keep in mind that booting might be slow due to the large file size. Also, you may need to adjust the `imgargs` line if Manjaro Sway has specific boot requirements.

If you encounter any issues during boot, we can troubleshoot by adjusting the boot parameters or checking the network transfer of the large image file.

Let me know how the testing goes or if you need any clarification on the next steps!

**Assistant** - 2024-06-28 05:04:35 UTC

 You're right to be concerned. The log you've shared shows some recurring issues:

1. PCIe Bus Errors:
   There are numerous PCIe Bus Errors being reported for device [8086:15da], which is an Intel device. These errors are marked as "Correctable" and of type "Data Link Layer", specifically "BadDLLP" (Bad Data Link Layer Packet).

2. vgscan failures:
   The command '/sbin/vgscan --ignorelockingfailure --mknodes' is failing repeatedly with exit code 5.

Let's break these down:

PCIe Errors:
- These are occurring on the PCIe port at address 0000:02:00.0
- While they're marked as "Correctable", the frequency of these errors suggests a persistent issue
- This could be due to a hardware problem, loose connection, or possibly a driver issue

vgscan failures:
- vgscan is a command used to scan for volume groups in LVM (Logical Volume Management)
- The failure could indicate issues with your storage setup or LVM configuration

To address these issues:

1. For the PCIe errors:
   - Check the physical connections of your PCIe devices
   - Update your system BIOS and device drivers
   - You may need to identify which specific device is at 0000:02:00.0 and investigate it further

2. For the vgscan failures:
   - Check your LVM setup
   - Investigate any recent changes to your storage configuration
   - Look for any disk or filesystem errors

These issues, particularly the persistent PCIe errors, could potentially lead to system instability or performance problems. It would be wise to address them soon.

Would you like me to guide you through some more detailed troubleshooting steps for either of these issues?

 Ah, I see. You're right to be concerned about these discrepancies. Let's address these issues one by one:

1. Unusual file type:
   If you don't see any other images of this file type in your netboot.xyz setup, it could mean that the .raw.xz format isn't what netboot.xyz typically expects. Most netboot.xyz entries use kernel and initrd files separately, not a single compressed disk image.

2. Showing as untracked in the web interface:
   This suggests that netboot.xyz doesn't recognize the file as part of its standard configuration. It's seeing the file in the assets directory but doesn't know how to use it.

Given these observations, we might need to adjust our approach. Here are some potential next steps:

1. Check file format:
   - Verify if netboot.xyz can directly boot from a .raw.xz file. It might need the kernel and initrd extracted separately.

2. Extract kernel and initrd:
   - If needed, we might have to extract the kernel and initrd from your Manjaro Sway image.
   - This would involve mounting the image and copying out the necessary files.

3. Create separate menu entry:
   - Instead of trying to boot the whole image, create a menu entry that points to separate kernel and initrd files.

4. Use alternative boot method:
   - Consider using iPXE's memdisk to load the entire image, if that's supported by netboot.xyz.

5. Check netboot.xyz documentation:
   - Review the netboot.xyz docs to see if there's a specific way to add custom full disk images.

6. File naming convention:
   - Ensure the file name follows any required conventions for netboot.xyz.

Here's a suggested plan:

1. Rename your file to something like `manjaro-sway-custom.img.xz` to differentiate it.
2. Try creating a custom menu entry that uses memdisk to load this image.
3. If that doesn't work, we'll need to extract the kernel and initrd from the image and create a more standard boot entry.

Would you like to try this approach, or do you have any other ideas based on what you've seen in the netboot.xyz interface?

one other thing i'm finding a bit off, i don't see any other images of this file type, and also it's showing up as untracked in the web interface?

 Great to hear you have Guacamole working well! Now, regarding your question about OPNsense firewall rules, let's clarify the differences between the destination options:

1. * (Asterisk):
   - This means "any" or "all".
   - It matches all possible destinations.
   - Use this when you want the rule to apply to traffic going anywhere.

2. /*(network):
   - This refers to any address within a specific network.
   - You'd typically see this followed by a network address and subnet mask (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
   - Use this when you want to match all addresses within a particular subnet.

3. /*(address):
   - This refers to a specific IP address.
   - You'd use this when you want the rule to apply only to traffic going to or from a particular IP address.

Here's how you might use each:

- *: If you want the rule to apply regardless of where the traffic is going.
- /*(network): If you want the rule to apply to all devices on your local network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
- /*(address): If you want the rule to apply only to a specific device (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

When creating rules, consider:
- More specific rules (like /*(address)) should generally come before more general rules (*).
- Be cautious with * rules, especially for allowing traffic, as they can potentially open up your network more than intended.

Does this help clarify the differences? Let me know if you need any specific examples for your setup!

so it seems i have guacamole working pretty well.. how do the opnsense settings for destination in a rule change between * /* net and /* address? (slashes included to not trigger markdown) or maybe i did? *

 Ah, I see. Thank you for clarifying. In OPNsense, when you're creating firewall rules and selecting the source or destination, you'll indeed see options like "LAN net", "LAN address", "WAN net", "WAN address", etc. Let me explain the difference:

1. [Interface] net:
   - This refers to the entire subnet associated with that interface.
   - For example, "LAN net" might represent 192.168.1.0/24 if that's your LAN subnet.
   - Use this when you want the rule to apply to all devices on that network.

2. [Interface] address:
   - This refers specifically to the IP address of the OPNsense router on that interface.
   - For example, "LAN address" might be 192.168.1.1 if that's your router's LAN IP.
   - Use this when you want the rule to apply only to traffic directly to/from the router on that interface.

Examples of when to use each:

- Use "LAN net" as the source if you want the rule to apply to all devices on your LAN.
- Use "WAN address" as the destination if you're creating a port forward rule to the router itself.
- Use "DMZ net" as the destination if you want to allow access to all devices in your DMZ from another network.

Remember:
- "net" is broader and includes all devices on that subnet.
- "address" is specific to the router's IP on that interface.

This distinction allows for more granular control over your firewall rules. Does this help explain what you're seeing in the OPNsense interface?

sorry.. to be more clear. each of my interfaces results in a ___ net or ___ address wjen choosing source and destination for a rule
