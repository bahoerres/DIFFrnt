i'm chatting with a friend about a d&d campaign that we're in and i want to explain shadow and bone to him. 

the campaign has this thing called the fog, and "ink" which is some sort of infused essence. a fuel, of sorts. there's airships, a large academy.. actually, the campaign is called The Big Gamble, if you can find any references to it. 

but we're in a text message conversation. i need to whittle it down to just the key points, even with him being completely unfamiliar with shadow and bone.

 I don't have specific information about the D&D campaign called "The Big Gamble" that you're referring to. However, I can help you summarize the key points of Shadow and Bone in a concise way for your friend, focusing on elements that seem similar to your campaign. Here's a brief explanation you could use in a text message:

"Shadow and Bone is a fantasy series with some similarities to our campaign. Key points:

1. A dark, monster-filled area called the Shadow Fold (like our Fog)
2. People with magical abilities called Grisha (might be similar to how 'ink' works for us)
3. A military/magical academy for training
4. Steampunk-ish technology in a fantasy setting (reminds me of our airships)
5. Political intrigue and power struggles

The main character discovers she has rare powers that could change everything."

This summary hits the main points without going into too much detail. Let me know if you want me to expand on any part of this or adjust it to better fit your campaign's specifics.
