i'm using swww to modify and set my wallpaper in hyprland on arch. attached are some of the script that  it involved.. having two different monitors, i'd like to be able to have separate images, if possible... 

take a look and let's see what we can do.

 I've reviewed the scripts you provided for managing wallpapers using swww on Hyprland. Currently, your setup is designed to set the same wallpaper across all monitors. Let's modify these scripts to support separate images for two different monitors.

Here's a plan to achieve this:

1. Modify the `set_background.sh` script (which isn't provided, but we can infer its function).
2. Update the `wall` and `wall_schedule` scripts to handle two monitors.

Let's start by modifying the `wall` script:

<antThinking>This modification is substantial and self-contained, making it a good candidate for an artifact. It's an update to an existing script, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="wall" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated wall script for dual monitors">
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

# Get two random images
IMAGE1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))
IMAGE2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))

# Set different wallpapers for each monitor
/home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2"

# Restart wall_schedule
killall wall_schedule
/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule &
</antArtifact>

Now, let's update the `wall_schedule` script:

<antThinking>This is another substantial modification to an existing script, so we'll create an artifact with the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="wall_schedule" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated wall_schedule script for dual monitors">
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"
LIST1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
LIST2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))

while true
do
    for i in "${!LIST1[@]}"
    do
        set_background.sh "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST1[i]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST2[i]}"
        sleep 1h
    done
    # Reshuffle the lists after going through all images
    LIST1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
    LIST2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
done
</antArtifact>

Now, we need to modify the `set_background.sh` script to handle two images. Since you didn't provide this script, I'll give you a template for how it should look:

<antThinking>This is a new script that we're creating based on inferred functionality, so it's a good candidate for a new artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="set_background" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="set_background.sh script for dual monitors">
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <image1> <image2>"
    exit 1
fi

# Get monitor IDs
MONITOR1=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[0].id')
MONITOR2=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[1].id')

# Set wallpapers
swww img -o $MONITOR1 "$1"
swww img -o $MONITOR2 "$2"
</antArtifact>

Lastly, let's update the `start_wall` script:

<antThinking>This is another update to an existing script, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="start_wall" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated start_wall script for dual monitors">
#!/bin/bash
$(swww kill && swww-daemon) || swww-daemon

IMG_NAME1=$(ls /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy | shuf -n 1)
IMG_NAME2=$(ls /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy | shuf -n 1)
IMG_PATH1=$HOME"/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/"$IMG_NAME1
IMG_PATH2=$HOME"/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/"$IMG_NAME2

set_background.sh "$IMG_PATH1" "$IMG_PATH2"
/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule &
</antArtifact>

These modifications will allow you to set different wallpapers on your two monitors. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. `wall` script now selects two random images and passes them to `set_background.sh`.
2. `wall_schedule` script now maintains two separate lists of shuffled images and sets them in pairs.
3. `set_background.sh` (new script) takes two image paths and sets them to the respective monitors using `swww`.
4. `start_wall` script now selects two random images on startup.

To implement these changes:

1. Replace your existing `wall` and `wall_schedule` scripts with the new versions.
2. Create the new `set_background.sh` script in `/home/blake/.local/bin/` and make it executable (`chmod +x set_background.sh`).
3. Replace your existing `start_wall` script with the new version.

Make sure to test these changes carefully. If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you refine the solution.

 Thank you for providing the `set_background.sh` script. This is very helpful. Now we can modify it to handle two monitors. Let's update this script to work with our dual monitor setup:

<antThinking>This is a substantial modification to an existing script that's central to the wallpaper-setting functionality. It's a good candidate for an artifact update, using the same identifier as before.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="set_background" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated set_background.sh script for dual monitors">
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <image1> <image2>"
    exit 1
fi

IMAGE1="$1"
IMAGE2="$2"
CURRENT_WALLPAPER="$HOME/.cache/swww/cache.txt"
ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1=$(realpath "$IMAGE1")
ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE2=$(realpath "$IMAGE2")

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER" ]; then
    # File does not exist, create it
    touch "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"
fi

# Get monitor IDs
MONITOR1=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[0].id')
MONITOR2=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[1].id')

# Command to change wallpaper for monitor 1
swww img -o $MONITOR1 "$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-bezier .43,1.19,1,.4 \
    --transition-type grow \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-pos top-right

# Command to change wallpaper for monitor 2
swww img -o $MONITOR2 "$IMAGE2" \
    --transition-bezier .43,1.19,1,.4 \
    --transition-type grow \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-pos top-right

# Update the cache file
{
    echo "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1"
    echo "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE2"
    tail -n +3 "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"
} > temp.txt && mv temp.txt "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"

notify-send "Wallpapers Changed" -i "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1" "Monitor 1: $IMAGE1\nMonitor 2: $IMAGE2"
</antArtifact>

This updated script now:

1. Accepts two image paths as arguments.
2. Uses `hyprctl` to get the IDs of both monitors.
3. Sets different wallpapers for each monitor using `swww img` with the appropriate monitor ID.
4. Updates the cache file with both wallpaper paths.
5. Sends a notification with information about both changed wallpapers.

To implement this change:

1. Replace your existing `set_background.sh` script in `/home/blake/.local/bin/` with this new version.
2. Make sure it's executable: `chmod +x /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh`

Now, let's quickly review and update the other scripts to ensure they work with this new dual-monitor setup:

1. The `wall` script we modified earlier is good as-is. It will call `set_background.sh` with two image paths.

2. The `wall_schedule` script we modified earlier is also good as-is. It will continuously set new wallpaper pairs.

3. Let's update the `start_wall` script one more time to ensure it's fully compatible:

<antThinking>This is a minor update to the previously modified script, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="start_wall" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Final update to start_wall script for dual monitors">
#!/bin/bash
$(swww kill && swww-daemon) || swww-daemon

IMG_NAME1=$(ls /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy | shuf -n 1)
IMG_NAME2=$(ls /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy | shuf -n 1)
IMG_PATH1=$HOME"/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/"$IMG_NAME1
IMG_PATH2=$HOME"/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/"$IMG_NAME2

/home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$IMG_PATH1" "$IMG_PATH2"
/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule &
</antArtifact>

With these changes, your system should now be set up to use different wallpapers on your two monitors. The wallpapers will change every hour (as set in the `wall_schedule` script), and you can also change them manually by running the `wall` script.

To implement these final changes:

1. Replace your existing `start_wall` script with this new version.
2. Make sure all scripts are executable.

After making these changes, restart your Hyprland session or run the `start_wall` script manually to see the new dual-monitor wallpaper setup in action.

If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you refine the solution.

uhhh.. it's currently stuck in a loop.. i keep getting notifications that wallpapers have changesd, but they aren't rendering. and is constant.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-26 23:37:51 UTC

 I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's troubleshoot this issue step by step. The constant notifications suggest that the `wall_schedule` script might be running in a tight loop without proper delays. Let's modify our scripts to address this and add some debugging information.

First, let's update the `wall_schedule` script:

<antThinking>We need to modify the wall_schedule script to add proper delays and debugging. This is a significant change to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="wall_schedule" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated wall_schedule script with debugging">
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"
LIST1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
LIST2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))

echo "Starting wall_schedule script" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log

while true
do
    for i in "${!LIST1[@]}"
    do
        echo "Setting wallpapers: ${LIST1[i]} and ${LIST2[i]}" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST1[i]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST2[i]}"
        
        echo "Sleeping for 1 hour" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        sleep 1h
    done
    echo "Reshuffling wallpaper lists" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
    LIST1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
    LIST2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
done
</antArtifact>

Now, let's modify the `set_background.sh` script to add more debugging information:

<antThinking>We need to update the set_background script to add debugging information. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

    touch "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"

# Get monitor IDs
MONITOR1=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[0].id')
MONITOR2=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[1].id')

echo "Monitor IDs: $MONITOR1 and $MONITOR2" >> /tmp/set_background.log

# Command to change wallpaper for monitor 1
echo "Setting wallpaper for monitor 1" >> /tmp/set_background.log
swww img -o $MONITOR1 "$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-bezier .43,1.19,1,.4 \
    --transition-type grow \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-pos top-right

# Command to change wallpaper for monitor 2
echo "Setting wallpaper for monitor 2" >> /tmp/set_background.log
swww img -o $MONITOR2 "$IMAGE2" \
    --transition-bezier .43,1.19,1,.4 \
    --transition-type grow \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-pos top-right

# Update the cache file
echo "Updating cache file" >> /tmp/set_background.log
{
    echo "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1"
    echo "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE2"
    tail -n +3 "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"
} > temp.txt && mv temp.txt "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"

notify-send "Wallpapers Changed" -i "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1" "Monitor 1: $IMAGE1\nMonitor 2: $IMAGE2"
echo "set_background.sh completed" >> /tmp/set_background.log
</antArtifact>

Now, let's update the `wall` script to ensure it's not causing the loop:

<antThinking>We need to update the wall script to ensure it's not causing the loop. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="wall" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated wall script with debugging">
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get two random images

IMAGE2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Set different wallpapers for each monitor
/home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2"

echo "Wallpapers set, now restarting wall_schedule" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Restart wall_schedule
pkill wall_schedule
/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule &

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
</antArtifact>

After making these changes:

1. Replace the existing scripts with these updated versions.
2. Make sure all scripts are executable: 
   ```
   chmod +x /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule
   chmod +x /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh
   chmod +x /path/to/wall/script
   ```
3. Kill any running instances of these scripts:
   ```
   pkill wall_schedule
   pkill set_background.sh
   ```
4. Run the `wall` script manually to start the process:
   ```
   /path/to/wall/script
   ```

Now, monitor the log files:
```
tail -f /tmp/wall_schedule.log /tmp/set_background.log /tmp/wall.log
```

This will help us understand what's happening in real-time. If you're still experiencing issues, please share the output of these log files.

Also, check if `swww` is running correctly:
```
pgrep swww-daemon
```

If it's not running, start it manually:
```
swww init
```

These changes should help identify the source of the loop and resolve the issue. If problems persist, we may need to investigate further based on the log output.

**Assistant** - 2024-08-26 23:41:47 UTC

 Thank you for providing that output. It seems there are a few issues we need to address:

1. The "none of the requested outputs are valid" error suggests that `swww` is having trouble identifying or accessing your monitors.
2. The `wall_schedule` process wasn't found, which means it might not have started correctly.
3. The `swww` daemon seems to be initializing, but it's reporting some warnings about transforms.

Let's tackle these issues one by one:

1. First, let's check your monitor setup:

   Run the following command and share the output:
   ```
   hyprctl monitors
   ```

2. Let's modify the `set_background.sh` script to use monitor names instead of IDs:

<antThinking>We need to update the set_background script to use monitor names and add more error checking. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antThinking>We need to update the wall_schedule script to add more error checking and logging. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

    LIST1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
    LIST2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
done
</antArtifact>

4. Now, let's update the `wall` script to ensure it's starting `wall_schedule` correctly:

<antThinking>We need to update the wall script to ensure it's starting wall_schedule correctly. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="wall" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated wall script with improved process management">
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

nohup /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule > /dev/null 2>&1 &

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
</antArtifact>

After making these changes:

1. Replace the existing scripts with these updated versions.
2. Make sure all scripts are executable:
   ```
   chmod +x /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule
   chmod +x /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh
   chmod +x /path/to/wall/script

3. Restart the `swww` daemon:
   ```
   swww kill
   swww init
   ```
4. Run the `wall` script manually to start the process:
   ```
   /path/to/wall/script
   ```

Now, monitor the log files again:
```
tail -f /tmp/wall_schedule.log /tmp/set_background.log /tmp/wall.log
```

These changes should help address the issues you're experiencing. The scripts now use monitor names instead of IDs, which should resolve the "none of the requested outputs are valid" error. We've also added more error checking and logging to help identify any remaining issues.

If you're still experiencing problems, please share:
1. The output of `hyprctl monitors`
2. The contents of the log files after running the `wall` script
3. Any error messages you see in the terminal or system logs

With this information, we can further diagnose and resolve any remaining issues.

 Thank you for providing the monitor information. It's clear that you have two monitors: HDMI-A-1 and DP-3. Let's update the `set_background.sh` script to use these specific monitor names:

<antThinking>We need to update the set_background script to use the specific monitor names from the user's setup. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="set_background" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated set_background.sh script with specific monitor names">

echo "set_background.sh completed" >> /tmp/set_background.log
</antArtifact>

Now, let's make sure the `wall_schedule` script is running correctly:

<antThinking>We need to update the wall_schedule script to ensure it's running continuously and handling errors properly. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="wall_schedule" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated wall_schedule script with improved error handling">

        sleep 1h
    done
    echo "Reshuffling wallpaper lists" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
done
</antArtifact>

Finally, let's update the `wall` script to ensure it's starting `wall_schedule` correctly:

<antThinking>We need to update the wall script to ensure it's starting wall_schedule correctly and handling any existing processes. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="wall" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated wall script with improved process management">

FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get two random images
IMAGE1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))
IMAGE2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Set different wallpapers for each monitor

echo "Wallpapers set, now restarting wall_schedule" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Restart wall_schedule

nohup /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule > /dev/null 2>&1 &

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
</antArtifact>

Now, follow these steps to implement the changes:

1. Replace the existing scripts with these updated versions.
2. Make sure all scripts are executable:
   ```
   chmod +x /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule
   chmod +x /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh
   chmod +x /path/to/wall/script
   ```
3. Restart the `swww` daemon:
   ```
   swww kill
   swww init
   ```
4. Run the `wall` script manually to start the process:
   ```
   /path/to/wall/script
   ```

After running these steps, monitor the log files:
```
tail -f /tmp/wall_schedule.log /tmp/set_background.log /tmp/wall.log
```

These changes should resolve the issues you were experiencing. The scripts now use the specific monitor names from your setup, which should prevent the "none of the requested outputs are valid" error. We've also improved error handling and logging to help identify any remaining issues.

If you're still encountering problems, please share the contents of the log files after running the `wall` script. This will help us further diagnose and resolve any remaining issues.

ohh, swww will get all uppity. init is deprecated.. it's swww-daemon now. hehe

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-26 23:44:14 UTC

 Ah, you're absolutely right! I apologize for the oversight. Thank you for pointing that out. Let's update our approach to use the current `swww` commands. 

Let's modify the instructions for starting `swww`:

<antThinking>We need to update our instructions for starting swww to use the current command. This isn't a script modification, but it's important information for the user.</antThinking>

Instead of:
```
swww kill
swww init
```

Use:
```
killall swww-daemon
swww-daemon
```

Now, let's update the `start_wall` script to ensure it's using the correct `swww` commands:

<antThinking>We need to update the start_wall script to use the current swww commands. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="start_wall" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Updated start_wall script with current swww commands">
#!/bin/bash
$(killall swww-daemon && swww-daemon) || swww-daemon

IMG_NAME1=$(ls /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy | shuf -n 1)
IMG_NAME2=$(ls /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy | shuf -n 1)
IMG_PATH1=$HOME"/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/"$IMG_NAME1
IMG_PATH2=$HOME"/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/"$IMG_NAME2

/home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$IMG_PATH1" "$IMG_PATH2"
/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule &
</antArtifact>

This script now uses `killall swww-daemon` instead of `swww kill`, and `swww-daemon` instead of `swww init`.

To implement these changes:

1. Update your `start_wall` script with the new version provided above.
2. Make sure the script is executable:
   ```
   chmod +x /path/to/start_wall
   ```
3. Run the `start_wall` script to initialize `swww` and set your initial wallpapers:
   ```
   /path/to/start_wall
   ```

The other scripts (`set_background.sh`, `wall_schedule`, and `wall`) don't need to be modified for this change, as they don't directly interact with the `swww-daemon` command.

After making these changes, your wallpaper system should work correctly with the current version of `swww`. The wallpapers should change on both monitors, and the `wall_schedule` script should continue to update them periodically.

If you encounter any issues or if the wallpapers aren't changing as expected, please let me know, and we can further troubleshoot. Also, don't forget to check the log files we set up earlier for any error messages or unexpected behavior:

```
tail -f /tmp/wall_schedule.log /tmp/set_background.log /tmp/wall.log
```

This will give us valuable information if any problems persist.

**Human** - 2024-08-26 23:47:55 UTC

could i symlink to my .local/bin/ and be able to call just the script name?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-26 23:47:55 UTC

 Absolutely! Symlinking to your `.local/bin/` directory is an excellent way to make your scripts easily accessible from anywhere in your system. This is a common practice for user-specific executables.

Here's how you can do it:

1. First, make sure that `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. You can check this by running:

   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

   If you don't see `~/.local/bin` in the output, you should add it to your PATH by adding this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` (depending on which shell you're using):

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   After adding this, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`) to apply the changes.

2. Now, let's create symlinks for your scripts. Assuming your scripts are in `/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/`, you can create symlinks like this:

<antThinking>We're providing instructions for creating symlinks. This isn't a script modification, but it's important information for the user to easily access their scripts.</antThinking>

   ```bash
   ln -s /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/start_wall ~/.local/bin/start_wall
   ln -s /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule ~/.local/bin/wall_schedule
   ln -s /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall ~/.local/bin/wall
   ln -s /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh ~/.local/bin/set_background
   ```

   Note: For `set_background.sh`, I've removed the `.sh` extension in the symlink name. This is optional, but it's common practice to omit file extensions for command-line tools.

3. Make sure all your original scripts are executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/start_wall
   chmod +x /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule
   chmod +x /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall
   chmod +x /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh
   ```

After doing this, you should be able to run your scripts from anywhere by simply typing their names:

```bash
start_wall
wall
wall_schedule
set_background
```

This setup has several advantages:
1. You can run your scripts from any directory.
2. You don't need to remember the full path to your scripts.
3. If you move your scripts to a different directory, you only need to update the symlinks, not any other scripts or configurations that might be calling these scripts.

Remember, if you make any changes to the original scripts, they will automatically be reflected when you run the commands, as symlinks just point to the original files.

If you want to remove a symlink in the future, you can use the `unlink` command:

```bash
unlink ~/.local/bin/script_name
```

This setup should make it much more convenient for you to manage and use your wallpaper scripts!

**Human** - 2024-08-28 00:25:04 UTC

one last little tweak.. 

one of my monitors is portrait oriented (DP3) is there a way to specify "fill" for the backgrounds somewhere alter how it's scaled?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-28 00:25:04 UTC

 Certainly! We can modify the `swww img` command in the `set_background.sh` script to use the `--resize` option, which allows us to specify how the image should be scaled. For a portrait-oriented monitor, the "fill" option would be ideal.

Let's update the `set_background.sh` script to accommodate this:

<antThinking>We need to update the set_background script to use different resize options for each monitor, particularly for the portrait-oriented DP-3. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

notify-send "Wallpapers Changed" -i "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1" "Monitor 1: $IMAGE1\nMonitor 2: $IMAGE2"
echo "set_background.sh completed" >> /tmp/set_background.log
</antArtifact>

In this updated script:

1. For the landscape monitor (HDMI-A-1), we're using `--resize fit`. This will scale the image to fit within the screen while maintaining its aspect ratio.

2. For the portrait monitor (DP-3), we're using `--resize fill`. This will scale the image to fill the entire screen, potentially cropping parts of the image if necessary.

The `swww img` command supports several resize options:

- `fit`: Fit the image within the screen dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
- `fill`: Fill the screen, cropping the image if necessary.
- `stretch`: Stretch the image to fit the screen, potentially distorting it.
- `center`: Center the image without scaling.

You can experiment with these options to find what works best for your setup. If you find that `fill` crops too much of the image on your portrait monitor, you might want to try `fit` for both monitors and see if that gives better results.

To implement this change:

1. Replace your existing `set_background.sh` script with this new version.
2. Make sure the script is still executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/set_background.sh
   ```
3. Run your `wall` script to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   wall
   ```

This should now properly handle your portrait-oriented monitor, filling the screen with the wallpaper image. If you find that you need to adjust the resize options further, you can easily modify the `--resize` parameter for each monitor in the script.

**Human** - 2024-08-28 00:41:05 UTC

seems that most background mangers do support those options.. swww unfortunately seems to run on a "no, crop, fit" system, and none of them fix this issue on monitor2

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-28 00:41:05 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and thank you for bringing this to my attention. It seems I made an incorrect assumption about swww's capabilities. Let's work with what swww actually supports and see if we can find a solution that works best for your setup.

As you've pointed out, swww supports these options:

- No resize (default)
- Crop
- Fit

Given this limitation, let's modify our approach. We'll use the "fit" option for both monitors, as it's likely to give the best results across different image aspect ratios. Then, we'll add a note about manually cropping images for the portrait monitor if needed.

Here's an updated version of the `set_background.sh` script:

<antThinking>We need to update the set_background script to use the correct swww options and provide a workaround for the portrait monitor issue. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

</antArtifact>

This script uses the "fit" option for both monitors, which should work reasonably well for most images. However, for the portrait monitor, you might want to consider the following workaround:

1. Create a separate folder for portrait-oriented wallpapers.
2. Pre-crop or create images specifically for your portrait monitor's aspect ratio.
3. Modify the `wall` and `wall_schedule` scripts to select images from different folders for each monitor.

Here's how you could modify the `wall` script to implement this:

IMAGE2=($(ls $PORTRAIT_FOLDER | shuf -n 1))

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Set different wallpapers for each monitor
/home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$LANDSCAPE_FOLDER/$IMAGE1" "$PORTRAIT_FOLDER/$IMAGE2"

echo "Wallpapers set, now restarting wall_schedule" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Restart wall_schedule
pkill -f "/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule"
nohup /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule > /dev/null 2>&1 &

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
</antArtifact>

You'll need to make a similar modification to your `wall_schedule` script.

To implement this workaround:

1. Create two new folders: 
   ```
   mkdir -p /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/landscape
   mkdir -p /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/portrait
   ```

2. Move your existing wallpapers to the appropriate folders based on their orientation.

3. For the portrait folder, you may want to crop or create images that match your portrait monitor's aspect ratio for the best results.

4. Update your scripts as shown above.

5. Run the `wall` script to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   wall
   ```

This solution isn't perfect, but it should give you better results for your portrait monitor without requiring changes to swww itself. The "fit" option will ensure that the entire image is visible on both monitors, and by using pre-cropped images for the portrait monitor, you can ensure that they fill the screen appropriately.

If this doesn't solve the issue to your satisfaction, you might want to consider using a different wallpaper manager that has more robust support for different monitor orientations, or you could look into contributing to swww to add support for more resize options.

 I understand completely. Sometimes, the perfect solution requires more effort than it's worth at the moment. Your approach of putting it on a "someday" list is very practical.

For now, let's stick with a simple solution that works reasonably well, even if it's not perfect. We'll use the "fit" option for both monitors, which should at least ensure that the entire image is visible on both screens without distortion.

Here's a final version of the `set_background.sh` script that uses this approach:

<antThinking>We'll provide a simplified version of the set_background script that uses the 'fit' option for both monitors. This is an update to an existing artifact, so we'll use the same identifier.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="set_background" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Simplified set_background.sh script using 'fit' for both monitors">
#!/bin/bash

echo "set_background.sh started with arguments: $@" >> /tmp/set_background.log

if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <image1> <image2>" >> /tmp/set_background.log
    exit 1
fi

IMAGE1="$1"
IMAGE2="$2"
CURRENT_WALLPAPER="$HOME/.cache/swww/cache.txt"
ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1=$(realpath "$IMAGE1")
ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE2=$(realpath "$IMAGE2")

echo "Setting wallpapers: $ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1 and $ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE2" >> /tmp/set_background.log

# Define monitor names
MONITOR1="HDMI-A-1"
MONITOR2="DP-3"

echo "Using monitors: $MONITOR1 and $MONITOR2" >> /tmp/set_background.log

# Set wallpaper for monitor 1
swww img -o "$MONITOR1" "$IMAGE1" --resize fit

# Set wallpaper for monitor 2
swww img -o "$MONITOR2" "$IMAGE2" --resize fit

# Update the cache file
echo "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1" > "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"
echo "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE2" >> "$CURRENT_WALLPAPER"

notify-send "Wallpapers Changed" -i "$ABSOLUTE_PATH_IMAGE1" "Monitor 1: $IMAGE1\nMonitor 2: $IMAGE2"
echo "set_background.sh completed" >> /tmp/set_background.log
</antArtifact>

This script keeps things simple:

1. It uses the same "fit" option for both monitors, which will ensure the entire image is visible on each screen.
2. It still allows for different images on each monitor.
3. It maintains the cache file and sends a notification when wallpapers are changed.

You can continue to use this with your existing `wall` and `wall_schedule` scripts without any changes to your folder structure. The images may not fill the entire screen on your portrait monitor, but they will be fully visible and undistorted.

If you decide to tackle this issue in the future, you might consider:

1. Contributing to swww to add more resize options.
2. Creating a pre-processing script that automatically crops or resizes images for your portrait monitor.
3. Exploring other wallpaper managers that might offer more flexibility with different monitor orientations.

For now, this solution should work adequately without requiring significant changes to your setup or workflow. If you find that certain aspects of this setup are still bothersome, feel free to ask, and we can explore further tweaks or workarounds within the current limitations.

 I'm thrilled to hear that you're considering contributing and diving deeper into coding! That's an excellent approach, and it can be incredibly rewarding. Let's break down the GitHub workflow and then discuss how you might approach contributing to a project like swww.

GitHub Workflow:

1. Fork: Create a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account.
2. Clone: Download the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a branch: Make a new branch for your changes.
4. Make changes: Edit the code on your local machine.
5. Stage and commit: Prepare your changes and create a snapshot.
6. Push: Upload your changes to your fork on GitHub.
7. Pull Request: Propose your changes to the original repository.

Here's a more detailed guide:

<antThinking>A detailed guide on GitHub workflow and contributing to open-source projects would be beneficial for the user. This is substantial, self-contained content that the user might refer back to, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

# GitHub Workflow and Contributing Guide

## Understanding GitHub

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. Here's a breakdown of key concepts:

1. **Repository (Repo)**: A project's folder. It contains all of the project files and stores each file's revision history.

2. **Fork**: A copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

3. **Clone**: A local copy of a repository on your computer.

4. **Branch**: A parallel version of a repository. It allows you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

5. **Commit**: A change to one or more files in your branch. Each commit has a unique ID.

6. **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge your changes into the main project. It's where code review happens.

## Contributing Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Go to the GitHub page of the project you want to contribute to.
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**
   - Edit the files using your preferred text editor or IDE.

5. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "A brief description of your changes"
   ```

6. **Push Your Changes**
   ```
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub.
   - Click "New pull request" next to your branch.
   - Ensure the base repository is the original project and the head repository is your fork.
   - Add a title and description for your pull request.
   - Click "Create pull request".

## Best Practices

1. **Keep PRs Small and Focused**: Each PR should address one specific issue or feature.
2. **Write Good Commit Messages**: Be clear and concise about what changed and why.
3. **Follow the Project's Guidelines**: Many projects have contributing guidelines. Always read and follow them.
4. **Be Responsive**: If maintainers ask for changes, try to address them promptly.
5. **Be Patient**: Open source maintainers are often volunteers. It may take time for them to review your contribution.

## Getting Started with swww

1. Fork the swww repository: https://github.com/Horus645/swww
2. Clone your fork:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swww.git
   cd swww
   ```
3. Set up the development environment (follow the project's README for specific instructions).
4. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```
   git checkout -b add-resize-options
   ```
5. Make your changes, test thoroughly, and commit:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new resize options for different monitor orientations"
   ```
6. Push your changes:
   ```
   git push origin add-resize-options
   ```
7. Create a pull request on GitHub.

Remember, contributing to open source is also about communication. Don't hesitate to open an issue first to discuss your proposed changes with the maintainers. They can provide guidance and ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals.
</antArtifact>

This guide should give you a solid foundation for understanding GitHub and the contribution process. As for contributing to swww specifically:

1. Start by thoroughly reading the project's documentation and code. Understand how it currently handles image resizing.

2. Open an issue on the swww GitHub repository discussing your proposed changes. This allows you to get feedback from maintainers before you invest a lot of time in coding.

3. Once you have a clear plan, follow the steps in the guide to fork the repository, clone it, and create a branch for your changes.

4. Implement the new resize options. This will likely involve modifying the image processing logic in the Rust code.

5. Test your changes thoroughly on different monitor setups.

6. Submit your pull request with a clear description of what you've changed and why.

Remember, contributing to open source is a learning process. Don't be afraid to ask questions or seek help if you get stuck. The maintainers and community are usually happy to assist newcomers.

If you need help understanding specific parts of the swww codebase or Rust in general, feel free to ask. Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable pieces can make the task less daunting and more achievable.

**Human** - 2024-08-28 00:44:36 UTC

i've been considering the contributing route lately, and digging into coding has definitely been on my to-do list.. probabaly less of a someday and more of a "lets do this" at this point.. 

id also like a guide of sorts as to just how github works. like, i get the repo, clone, add, push, commit side of things.. and the general ideas make sense to me, but i need to have a better understanding of it to see how everything works.. the autistic beauty and frustration of bottom up learning

---

**Human** - 2024-08-28 00:46:55 UTC

the other thing i want to familiarize myself is a better dev environment? or a better understanding of it? i have rust, and go, and python installed so that i can run some of my customizations, and i've got neovim all decked out and pretty and easy to use.. but is it as simple as putting the code together and then making it executable and letting 'er rip (i understand that this is a gross simplification, but i think you can understand what i'm getting towards)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-28 00:46:55 UTC

 You're asking a great question, and you're right that there's more to a development environment than just having languages installed and an editor set up. Let's break down what a more comprehensive dev environment might look like, especially for contributing to projects like swww.

<antThinking>A detailed explanation of a comprehensive development environment would be valuable for the user's learning journey. This is substantial, self-contained content that the user might refer back to, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

# Comprehensive Development Environment Guide

## 1. Version Control System (VCS)
- Git is the most common. You already understand the basics, which is great.
- Consider learning about:
  - Git hooks for automating tasks
  - Git flow for managing branches in larger projects
  - Git submodules for managing dependencies

## 2. IDE/Text Editor
- You're using Neovim, which is excellent. Make sure you have:
  - Syntax highlighting for your languages (Rust, Go, Python)
  - Code completion (e.g., CoC, or built-in LSP)
  - Linting integration
  - Debugging capabilities (e.g., via DAP)

## 3. Build Tools
- For Rust: Cargo (comes with Rust)
- For Go: Go's built-in tools
- For Python: pip, virtualenv/venv

## 4. Package Managers
- Rust: Cargo
- Go: Go Modules
- Python: pip, conda

## 5. Testing Frameworks

- PDB for Python
- IDE integrations for debugging

## 7. Linters and Formatters
- Rust: rustfmt, clippy
- Go: gofmt, golint
- Python: pylint, black

## 8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins

## 9. Containerization
- Docker for creating consistent development and deployment environments

## 10. Documentation Tools
- Rust: rustdoc
- Go: godoc
- Python: Sphinx

## 11. Profiling Tools
- For performance optimization:
  - Rust: perf, flamegraph
  - Go: pprof
  - Python: cProfile

## 12. Environment Management
- Python: virtualenv, conda
- Use tools like direnv to manage project-specific environment variables

## 13. Dependency Management
- Keep track of project dependencies and their versions
- Use lock files to ensure consistent builds

## Setting Up for swww Development

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swww.git
   cd swww
   ```

2. **Set Up Rust Environment**:
   - Ensure you have the latest stable Rust:
     ```
     rustup update stable
     ```
   - Set up rustfmt and clippy:
     ```
     rustup component add rustfmt clippy
     ```

3. **IDE Configuration**:
   - Set up Rust-analyzer in Neovim for better code intelligence
   - Configure your Neovim for Rust development (syntax highlighting, auto-completion, etc.)

4. **Build the Project**:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

5. **Run Tests**:
   ```
   cargo test
   ```

6. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Create a `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/sh
     cargo fmt -- --check
     cargo clippy -- -D warnings
     ```
   - Make it executable:
     ```
     chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
     ```

7. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Look at the project's `.github/workflows` directory to understand the CI process

8. **Documentation**:
   - Generate and read the documentation:
     ```
     cargo doc --open
     ```

Remember, the actual development process involves:
1. Writing code
2. Running and debugging locally
3. Writing and running tests
4. Linting and formatting your code
5. Committing changes (which will trigger pre-commit hooks)
6. Pushing to GitHub (which will trigger CI)
7. Creating a Pull Request

This process ensures that your code is working, well-formatted, and passes all checks before it's reviewed by maintainers.
</antArtifact>

Now, to address your specific question: 

> is it as simple as putting the code together and then making it executable and letting 'er rip

While this can work for simple scripts or personal projects, for larger projects and especially when contributing to open-source:

1. **Building**: Most projects have a build process. For Rust projects like swww, you'd use `cargo build` to compile the code.

2. **Testing**: Before running, you should run the project's tests (`cargo test`) to ensure your changes haven't broken anything.

3. **Linting and Formatting**: Run tools like `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to ensure your code adheres to Rust's style guidelines.

4. **Documentation**: For any new features or changes, you might need to update or add documentation.

5. **Continuous Integration**: When you push your changes, CI systems will often run additional tests and checks.

So while it's not just "make it executable and let 'er rip", having a good development environment set up makes all these steps smoother and often automated.

For swww specifically, you'd:

1. Make your code changes
2. Run `cargo build` to compile
3. Test the compiled binary with different wallpapers and monitor setups
4. Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass
5. Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to lint and format your code
6. Commit your changes and push to GitHub
7. Create a Pull Request

Each project might have slightly different processes, so always check the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file (if it exists) for specific guidelines.

Remember, setting up a good dev environment is an iterative process. Start with the basics and gradually add tools and processes as you become more comfortable and see the need for them.

i'm using this snippet in my hyprlock.conf how can i modifufs6feh7b

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-28 15:55:17 UTC

 I apologize, but it seems your message was cut off abruptly. You mentioned using a snippet in your hyprlock.conf file, but the rest of your question is incomplete. Could you please provide the full question or context? 

It would be helpful if you could share:

1. The complete snippet you're using in your hyprlock.conf file
2. What you're trying to modify or achieve with this snippet
3. Any specific issues or errors you're encountering

Once you provide this information, I'll be able to offer more accurate and helpful advice on how to modify your hyprlock configuration.

**Human** - 2024-08-28 15:57:24 UTC

sorry. weird glitch.. 

# BACKGROUND
background {
    monitor =
    path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/cottage.jpg
    blur_passes = 3
    contrast = 0.8916
    brightness = 0.8172
    vibrancy = 0.1696
    vibrancy_darkness = 0.0
}

that's the snippet. i would like a different image from the same folder on my each of the two monitors

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-28 15:57:24 UTC

 Ah, I see. You want to set different background images for each of your two monitors in your hyprlock configuration. Unfortunately, hyprlock doesn't natively support setting different images for different monitors in a single `background` block. However, we can work around this by using multiple `background` blocks, each specifying a different monitor.

Here's how you can modify your snippet to achieve this:

<antThinking>We need to provide a modified hyprlock configuration that sets different backgrounds for two monitors. This is a substantial change to an existing configuration, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprlock-dual-monitor-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprlock configuration for dual monitors with different backgrounds">
# BACKGROUND
background {
    monitor = HDMI-A-1
    path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/cottage.jpg
    blur_passes = 3
    contrast = 0.8916
    brightness = 0.8172
    vibrancy = 0.1696
    vibrancy_darkness = 0.0
}

background {
    monitor = DP-3
    path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/forest.jpg  # Change this to another image in the same folder
    blur_passes = 3
    contrast = 0.8916
    brightness = 0.8172
    vibrancy = 0.1696
    vibrancy_darkness = 0.0
}
</antArtifact>

Here's what changed:

1. We've created two separate `background` blocks, one for each monitor.
2. Each `background` block now has a `monitor` parameter specifying which monitor it applies to. I've used `HDMI-A-1` and `DP-3` based on the monitor information you provided earlier. Make sure these match your actual monitor names.
3. The `path` in the second block points to a different image file. You'll need to replace `forest.jpg` with another image file from your `~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/` folder.

To use this configuration:

1. Replace the existing `background` block in your `hyprlock.conf` with these two blocks.
2. Make sure to change `forest.jpg` to an actual image file in your folder.
3. Verify that the monitor names (`HDMI-A-1` and `DP-3`) match your system. You can check your monitor names by running `hyprctl monitors` in a terminal.

If you want to randomize the images, you could create a script that modifies this configuration file before locking the screen. The script would randomly select two different images from the folder and update the `path` lines in the configuration file.

Here's a simple bash script that could do this:

<antThinking>A script to randomize background images for hyprlock would be useful for the user. This is a new, self-contained piece of code, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="hyprlock-random-backgrounds" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Script to set random backgrounds for hyprlock">
#!/bin/bash

WALLPAPER_DIR="$HOME/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf"

# Get two random images
IMAGE1=$(ls $WALLPAPER_DIR | shuf -n 1)
IMAGE2=$(ls $WALLPAPER_DIR | shuf -n 1)

# Ensure the images are different
while [ "$IMAGE1" = "$IMAGE2" ]; do
    IMAGE2=$(ls $WALLPAPER_DIR | shuf -n 1)
done

# Update the config file
sed -i "s|path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/.*|path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/$IMAGE1|" $CONFIG_FILE
sed -i "0,/path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/.*/! s|path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/.*|path = ~/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/$IMAGE2|" $CONFIG_FILE

# Lock the screen
hyprlock
</antArtifact>

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `~/.local/bin/hyprlock-random`.
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/hyprlock-random`.
3. Use this script instead of `hyprlock` when you want to lock your screen with random backgrounds.

Remember to adjust the `WALLPAPER_DIR` and `CONFIG_FILE` variables if your paths are different.

This setup will allow you to have different backgrounds on each monitor when you lock your screen, and you can easily randomize them by using the script.

**Human** - 2024-08-28 15:58:43 UTC

okay, cool. i figured it would be two blocks, just wanted to be certain. thanks!

---

**Assistant** - 2024-08-28 15:58:43 UTC

 You're welcome! I'm glad I could confirm your intuition about using two blocks. You've got a good grasp on how hyprlock configuration works.

Since you've got it figured out, here are a few additional tips that might be helpful:

1. If you decide to use the randomization script, you can bind it to a key in your Hyprland config. For example:

   ```
   bind = $mainMod, L, exec, ~/.local/bin/hyprlock-random
   ```

2. Remember that if you add or remove images from your wallpaper folder, the script will automatically include them in the rotation.

3. If you want to keep the same image on one monitor and only randomize the other, you can easily modify the script to only change one of the `sed` commands.

4. You can extend this concept to more than two monitors if needed in the future, just by adding more `background` blocks to your hyprlock.conf.

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or optimize in your hyprlock setup? Or do you have any other areas of your Hyprland configuration you're looking to improve?
