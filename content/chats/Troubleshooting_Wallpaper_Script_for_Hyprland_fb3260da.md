i'm trying to get a few kinks worked out with the wallpaper script i use for hyprland. code is attached, i was wondering if anything stood out right away that may look a little off... 

#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"
echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log
# Get two random images
IMAGE1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))
IMAGE2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))
echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log
# Set different wallpapers for each monitor
/home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2"
echo "Wallpapers set, now restarting wall_schedule" >> /tmp/wall.log
# Restart wall_schedule
pkill -f "/home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule"
nohup /home/blake/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule > /dev/null 2>&1 &
echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:13:58 UTC

 Looking at your wallpaper script, there are a few potential issues that stand out:

1. The array syntax for IMAGE1/IMAGE2 is problematic:
```bash
IMAGE1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf -n 1))  # Creates unnecessary array
```

2. Using `ls` for file operations isn't reliable due to potential whitespace/special characters in filenames.

Here's a cleaned up version:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get random images using find instead of ls
IMAGE1=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)
IMAGE2=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Use full paths with proper quoting
"$HOME/.local/bin/set_background.sh" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2"

echo "Wallpapers set, now restarting wall_schedule" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Use pkill more specifically
pkill -f "wall_schedule$"
nohup "$HOME/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule" > /dev/null 2>&1 &

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
```

Key improvements:
- Proper handling of filenames with spaces/special characters
- More specific process killing
- Using $HOME instead of hardcoded paths
- Proper quoting of variables and paths
- Removed unnecessary array usage

Also, consider adding a check to ensure the directory exists:
```bash
[[ ! -d "$FOLDER_PATH" ]] && { echo "Wallpaper directory not found"; exit 1; }
```

Want me to explain any of these changes in more detail?

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:15:09 UTC

the issue i'm having, it that it almost seems to run twice. i'll get the notification that the wallpapers are changing, but oftentimes the notification will show a different wallpaper than what actually displays.. 

could this have been caused by the ls issue?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:15:09 UTC

 The double execution/mismatch issue is likely not caused by the `ls` issue directly, but rather by the way the script handles `wall_schedule`. Let's break this down:

1. You're killing and restarting `wall_schedule` in the same script that's setting wallpapers, which could cause race conditions
2. The notification you're seeing might be coming from both the initial wallpaper set and the restarted `wall_schedule` process

Could you share what's in your `set_background.sh` and `wall_schedule` scripts? This would help identify where the duplicate notifications are coming from.

In the meantime, here's a modified version that might help prevent the double execution:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

# Add a lock file mechanism
LOCK_FILE="/tmp/wallpaper.lock"
if [ -e "$LOCK_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Another instance is running" >> /tmp/wall.log
    exit 1
fi
touch "$LOCK_FILE"

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get random images
IMAGE1=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)
IMAGE2=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Stop wall_schedule before setting background
pkill -f "wall_schedule$"
sleep 0.5  # Give it time to clean up

# Set wallpapers
"$HOME/.local/bin/set_background.sh" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2"

# Restart wall_schedule
nohup "$HOME/.config/hypr/scripts/wall_schedule" > /dev/null 2>&1 &

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
rm "$LOCK_FILE"  # Clean up lock file
```

Also, you might want to add a trap to clean up the lock file if the script exits unexpectedly:
```bash
trap 'rm -f "$LOCK_FILE"' EXIT
```

Is `wall_schedule` also changing wallpapers independently? If so, we might need to coordinate these processes better.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:16:38 UTC

this is the script that it was adapted from:

#!/bin/bash
# Get random image file name
IMG_NAME=$(ls /home/obsy/.config/hypr/wallpapers | shuf -n 1)
# full path to that random image file
IMG_PATH=/home/obsy/.config/hypr/wallpapers/$IMG_NAME
# Command to change wallpaper
swww img $IMG_PATH --transition-type center --transition-fps 60 --transition-speed 16

the need for the adaptation arose to try and get different images on each of my monitors.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:16:38 UTC

 Ah, I see - you're using `swww` for wallpaper management. The issue might be clearer now. Let's modify your script to work better with `swww` for dual monitors:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

# Ensure swww daemon is running
if ! pgrep -x "swww-daemon" > /dev/null; then
    swww init
    sleep 1
fi

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get random images
IMAGE1=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)
IMAGE2=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get monitor outputs
MONITORS=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[].name')

# Set wallpapers for each monitor
monitor_array=($MONITORS)
swww img -o "${monitor_array[0]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" --transition-type center --transition-fps 60 --transition-speed 16
swww img -o "${monitor_array[1]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2" --transition-type center --transition-fps 60 --transition-speed 16

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
```

Key changes:
- Uses `swww` directly instead of a separate `set_background.sh`
- Checks if `swww-daemon` is running
- Uses `hyprctl` to get monitor names dynamically
- Applies wallpapers to specific outputs using `swww`'s `-o` flag

This should be more reliable and avoid any double-execution issues. If you're still seeing the notification mismatch, could you share how you're generating the notifications? They might be coming from another script or service.

Also, if you want to schedule wallpaper changes, you might want to use a systemd timer instead of the `wall_schedule` script. Would you like me to show you how to set that up?

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:20:31 UTC

 Ah, my apologies - I used an outdated `swww` flag. The newer version uses `--transition-duration` instead of `--transition-speed`. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

# Ensure swww daemon is running
if ! pgrep -x "swww-daemon" > /dev/null; then
    swww init
    sleep 1
fi

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get random images
IMAGE1=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)
IMAGE2=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get monitor outputs
MONITORS=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[].name')

# Set wallpapers for each monitor
monitor_array=($MONITORS)
swww img -o "${monitor_array[0]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-type center \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1

swww img -o "${monitor_array[1]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2" \
    --transition-type center \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
```

The transition duration is now in seconds (1 = 1 second). You can adjust this value to your preference. Does this work better with your version of `swww`?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:21:22 UTC

effing, flawless!

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:21:22 UTC

 Nice! Glad it's working smoothly now. The `--transition-speed` vs `--transition-duration` thing is a common gotcha with newer `swww` versions.

Quick tip: If you want to make this run periodically, you could create a simple systemd user timer instead of using the wall_schedule script. Here's how:

```bash
# ~/.config/systemd/user/wallpaper.service
[Unit]
Description=Change Wallpaper

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=%h/.config/hypr/scripts/wall

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
# ~/.config/systemd/user/wallpaper.timer
[Unit]
Description=Change Wallpaper periodically

[Timer]
OnBootSec=1m
OnUnitActiveSec=30m

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Then just:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now wallpaper.timer
```

But if your current setup is working well, no need to change it! Sometimes simple is better.

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:22:45 UTC

wall schedule does a pretty good job. here's that script, since you asked earlier: 

#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"
echo "Starting wall_schedule script" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
while true
do
    LIST1=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
    LIST2=($(ls $FOLDER_PATH | shuf))
    for i in "${!LIST1[@]}"
    do
        echo "Setting wallpapers: ${LIST1[i]} and ${LIST2[i]}" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        if /home/blake/.local/bin/set_background.sh "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST1[i]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST2[i]}"; then
            echo "Wallpapers set successfully" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        else
            echo "Error setting wallpapers" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        fi
        
        echo "Sleeping for 1 hour" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        sleep 1h
    done
    echo "Reshuffling wallpaper lists" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
done


i don't know that i want to sink too much time into trying to modifiy this existing setup, with the fleshing out of the hyrpland suite, i'm planning on shifting to hyprpaper for my wallpaper handling. this works great for now though.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:22:45 UTC

 Yeah, makes sense not to over-optimize something that's working, especially if you're planning to switch to hyprpaper. That said, if you're curious, here's what I'd tweak in that script just for robustness:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

echo "Starting wall_schedule script" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log

while true; do
    # Use find instead of ls for better filename handling
    readarray -t LIST1 < <(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z | xargs -0 basename)
    readarray -t LIST2 < <(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z | xargs -0 basename)
    
    for i in "${!LIST1[@]}"; do
        echo "Setting wallpapers: ${LIST1[i]} and ${LIST2[i]}" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        
        if "$HOME/.local/bin/set_background.sh" "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST1[i]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST2[i]}"; then
            echo "Wallpapers set successfully" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        else
            echo "Error setting wallpapers" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
            # Maybe add error sleep to avoid rapid retries on persistent failures
            sleep 5
        fi
        
        echo "Sleeping for 1 hour" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        sleep 1h
    done
    echo "Reshuffling wallpaper lists" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
done
```

But yeah, hyprpaper will be nice - it's more integrated with the Hyprland ecosystem and should be snappier since it's built specifically for it. Good call on the planned migration.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:24:08 UTC

 Ah, my bad - the basename command is getting the full path instead of just the filename. Let's simplify the approach:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

echo "Starting wall_schedule script" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log

while true; do
    # Get list of just filenames
    cd "$FOLDER_PATH" || exit 1
    readarray -t LIST1 < <(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf "%f\n" | shuf)
    readarray -t LIST2 < <(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf "%f\n" | shuf)
    
    for i in "${!LIST1[@]}"; do
        echo "Setting wallpapers: ${LIST1[i]} and ${LIST2[i]}" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        
        if "$HOME/.local/bin/set_background.sh" "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST1[i]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/${LIST2[i]}"; then
            echo "Wallpapers set successfully" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        else
            echo "Error setting wallpapers" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
            sleep 5
        fi
        
        echo "Sleeping for 1 hour" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
        sleep 1h
    done
    echo "Reshuffling wallpaper lists" >> /tmp/wall_schedule.log
done
```

The key change is using `find`'s `-printf "%f\n"` to print just the filename instead of the full path, and changing to the target directory first. This should work better with your filenames. Or honestly, your original `ls` version was working fine too - sometimes trying to be too "correct" just adds complexity!

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:25:16 UTC

 Looking at the `swww` documentation, there are several built-in transition types you can try by replacing `center` with:

- `simple` - Basic fade transition
- `wipe` - Slides from one side to another
- `outer` - Like center but starts from edges inward
- `random` - Randomly selects a transition type
- `wave` - Ripple effect
- `grow` - Similar to center but with different growth pattern
- `fade` - Smooth fade between images
- `left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom` - Directional wipes

You can experiment by modifying the transition parameters. For example:

```bash
# Wave effect
swww img -o "${monitor_array[0]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-type wave \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1.5 \
    --transition-wave 20

# Wipe from left
swww img -o "${monitor_array[0]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-type wipe \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-angle 30  # Changes wipe angle
```

Want to try any specific one? We can modify your script to use it.

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:25:16 UTC

much better. 

curious: what do some of the other transition effects look like? this one is a circle that grows out from the middle of the screen with the new wallpaper.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:28:01 UTC

and to adapt to dual monitors?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:28:01 UTC

 Here's how to use different transition effects for dual monitors:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

# Ensure swww daemon is running
if ! pgrep -x "swww-daemon" > /dev/null; then
    swww init
    sleep 1
fi

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get random images
IMAGE1=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)
IMAGE2=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get monitor outputs
MONITORS=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[].name')

# Set wallpapers with different transitions for each monitor
monitor_array=($MONITORS)
swww img -o "${monitor_array[0]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-type wave \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1.5 \
    --transition-wave 20

swww img -o "${monitor_array[1]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2" \
    --transition-type wipe \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-angle 30

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
```

You can mix and match any of these transitions:
```bash
# Some cool combinations:
# Monitor 1    Monitor 2
# wave        outer
# wipe        fade
# grow        wave
# left        right   (creates a nice synchronized effect)
```

Just modify the `--transition-type` and related parameters for each monitor. Want to try any specific combination?

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:30:26 UTC

error: invalid value '20' for '--transition-wave <TRANSITION_WAVE>': Not enough values

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:30:26 UTC

 Ah, the `--transition-wave` parameter needs multiple values. Let me correct that:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

# Ensure swww daemon is running
if ! pgrep -x "swww-daemon" > /dev/null; then
    swww init
    sleep 1
fi

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get random images
IMAGE1=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)
IMAGE2=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get monitor outputs
MONITORS=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[].name')

# Set wallpapers with different transitions
monitor_array=($MONITORS)
swww img -o "${monitor_array[0]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-type wave \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1.5 \
    --transition-wave 20 0.5 20

swww img -o "${monitor_array[1]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2" \
    --transition-type wipe \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-angle 30

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
```

The wave transition takes three values:
- First number: number of waves (20)
- Second number: wave strength (0.5)
- Third number: wave spacing (20)

You can adjust these values to get different wave effects. For example:
- `--transition-wave 10 0.3 30` for fewer, gentler waves
- `--transition-wave 30 0.7 15` for more intense, tighter waves

Want to try different wave parameters?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:33:41 UTC

 Ah, looks like I misunderstood the syntax. Let's try again with proper syntax:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER_PATH="/home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy"

# Ensure swww daemon is running
if ! pgrep -x "swww-daemon" > /dev/null; then
    swww init
    sleep 1
fi

echo "wall script started" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get random images
IMAGE1=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)
IMAGE2=$(find "$FOLDER_PATH" -type f -print0 | shuf -z -n 1 | xargs -0 basename)

echo "Selected images: $IMAGE1 and $IMAGE2" >> /tmp/wall.log

# Get monitor outputs
MONITORS=$(hyprctl monitors -j | jq -r '.[].name')

# Set wallpapers with different transitions
monitor_array=($MONITORS)
swww img -o "${monitor_array[0]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE1" \
    --transition-type wave \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1.5

swww img -o "${monitor_array[1]}" "$FOLDER_PATH/$IMAGE2" \
    --transition-type wipe \
    --transition-fps 60 \
    --transition-duration 1 \
    --transition-angle 30

echo "wall script completed" >> /tmp/wall.log
```

I removed the wave parameters since they're causing issues. Looking at recent `swww` documentation, it seems the wave parameters might have changed. Let me check the exact syntax for your version - what does `swww img --help` show for the wave transition options?

as long as we're on hyprland, i believe one of the configs that i had run contained a shortcut to clear the desktop. wanna set me up something for that using SUPER SHIFT, D ?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:36:38 UTC

 For Hyprland, you can add a keybind to clear the desktop (hide/minimize all windows). Here's how:

Add this to your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```bash
# Clear desktop (minimize all windows)
bind = SUPER SHIFT, D, exec, hyprctl dispatch minimizeall
```

The `minimizeall` dispatch command is exactly what we want here - it'll minimize/hide all visible windows, effectively clearing your desktop so you can see your wallpaper. 

If you ever want to toggle this behavior (i.e., show/hide windows), you could use:
```bash
bind = SUPER SHIFT, D, exec, hyprctl dispatch togglespecialworkspace
```

But the `minimizeall` version is probably closer to what you're looking for, since it matches the traditional "show desktop" behavior from other desktop environments.

i already have a special workspace setup. i'll use the minimizeall and try that first.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:37:18 UTC

 Yeah, good call - especially if you're already using special workspaces for other things. The `minimizeall` is cleaner and won't interfere with your existing special workspace setup.

Just to confirm after you try it - if `minimizeall` doesn't feel quite right, there's also:
```bash
bind = SUPER SHIFT, D, exec, hyprctl dispatch focusmonitor cur; hyprctl dispatch togglefloating
```

But try the simple version first:
```bash
bind = SUPER SHIFT, D, exec, hyprctl dispatch minimizeall
```

And let me know if it works as expected!

neither one.. i did find though, 

i wonder if this was the keybind/action i was experiencing.. 

bind = $mainMod CTRL, down, workspace, empty # Open the next empty workspace

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:43:19 UTC

 Ah yes! That's a different but useful feature - it finds and switches to the next empty workspace. 

For your original request about clearing/showing desktop, let me try one more approach that should work:

```bash
bind = SUPER SHIFT, D, execr, hyprctl dispatch workspaceopt allfloat; hyprctl dispatch workspaceopt allpseudo
```

This toggles all windows between floating and pseudo-tiled states. It's a bit different from traditional "show desktop" but might achieve what you're looking for.

If that's not quite it, we could also look at:
```bash
bind = SUPER SHIFT, D, exec, hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspace special:minimize
```

But honestly, that workspace empty binding you found (`bind = $mainMod CTRL, down, workspace, empty`) is pretty sweet - it's a really clean way to get to a fresh workspace. Sometimes finding a different but better solution is better than recreating exactly what we remember!

 Yes, this output clearly shows that SDDM is your display manager/login screen. Specifically, we can see:

1. The main SDDM daemon running as root (PID 528)
2. X.org started by SDDM (PID 530)
3. SDDM helper process that launched your Hyprland session (PID 578)

If you're looking to configure SDDM, the main configuration files would be:
```bash
/etc/sddm.conf.d/          # Main config directory
/usr/share/sddm/themes/    # Default themes location
```

Want to customize something specific with SDDM? Common tweaks include:
- Theme selection
- Auto-login setup
- HiDPI settings
- Session handling
- Cursor/keyboard settings

Let me know what you're trying to set up and I can provide the relevant config snippets.

is this enough to infer that sddm is the login that i use? i'm trying to get this squared away as well .

**Human** - 2024-11-11 06:58:16 UTC

i would love to have tuigreet setup. 

issue is, i dont see anything in my .config for sddm?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 06:58:16 UTC

 That's normal - SDDM's configs are in `/etc`, not in your user's `.config`. To switch from SDDM to `tuigreet`, here's the process:

1. First, install tuigreet and greetd:
```bash
paru -S greetd greetd-tuigreet
```

2. Disable SDDM:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable sddm
```

3. Configure greetd by creating/editing `/etc/greetd/config.toml`:
```toml
[terminal]
vt = 1

[default_session]
command = "tuigreet --cmd Hyprland --remember-session"
user = "greeter"
```

4. Enable greetd:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable greetd
```

5. Create a nice config for tuigreet in `/etc/greetd/environments`:
```
Hyprland
```

If you want to customize tuigreet, you can modify the command options in the config. Some useful flags:
```bash
tuigreet --cmd Hyprland \
    --remember-session \
    --greeting "Welcome!" \
    --asterisks \
    --time
```

Want to try this out? We can test before making it permanent.

GREETD_SOCK must be defined

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 07:03:31 UTC

 Ah yes, for Hyprland to work with greetd, we need to set up the environment variable properly. 

1. Create/edit `/etc/greetd/config.toml`:
```toml
[terminal]
vt = 1

[default_session]
command = "tuigreet --cmd /etc/greetd/hyprland-start --remember-session"
user = "greeter"
```

2. Create a startup script at `/etc/greetd/hyprland-start`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
export XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland
export XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP=Hyprland
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Hyprland
export GREETD_SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/greetd.sock"

exec Hyprland
```

3. Make it executable:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/greetd/hyprland-start
```

4. Then follow the previous steps:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable sddm
sudo systemctl enable greetd
```

This should properly set up the GREETD_SOCK environment variable and other necessary Wayland/Hyprland variables. Want to try rebooting with these changes?

**Human** - 2024-11-11 07:08:19 UTC

is there an exec-once that i could put in my hyrpland.conf? 

this startup script seems a little out of the ordinary

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-11 07:08:19 UTC

 You can actually handle the GREETD_SOCK variable directly in your Hyprland config instead of using a separate startup script. 

Add this to your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```bash
# Set up GREETD_SOCK
env = GREETD_SOCK,$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/greetd.sock
```

Then we can simplify the greetd config in `/etc/greetd/config.toml`:
```toml
[terminal]
vt = 1

[default_session]
command = "tuigreet --cmd Hyprland --remember-session"
user = "greeter"
```

This is a cleaner approach since it keeps the environment setup in your Hyprland config where you're likely already managing other environment variables. Much simpler than maintaining a separate startup script!
