Loving unconditionally. Trying to wrestle with some thoughts this morning. 

If I love someone unconditionally but their actions are hurting me, I have discussed/expressed desires for change. If change does not happen or effort is not made to at least accommodate, loving unconditionally wouldn't dictate that I stay and suffer, right? Loving unconditionally would still be able to say "there's nothing you could do for me to stop loving you, but in an effort to protect myself I need to walk away"

 This is a really thoughtful and important reflection. You've actually touched on a crucial distinction - unconditional love doesn't mean unconditional tolerance or acceptance of harmful behavior, nor does it require unconditional presence in someone's life.

Unconditional love means that the fundamental care and compassion you feel for someone isn't dependent on their actions. But boundaries - which protect both yourself and the relationship - are not only compatible with unconditional love, they're often necessary for it to be healthy and sustainable.

Think of it like loving a child who is acting out destructively. You don't stop loving them, but you might need to create distance or boundaries to protect yourself and actually demonstrate what healthy relationships look like. Sometimes, stepping back is the most loving thing you can do - both for yourself and for them.

Your framing is quite wise: "There's nothing you could do for me to stop loving you, but in an effort to protect myself I need to walk away." This shows remarkable emotional maturity - you're holding both the unconditional nature of your love and your own need for self-protection in balance.
