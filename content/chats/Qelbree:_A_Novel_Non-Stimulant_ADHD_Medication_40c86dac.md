 Let me provide information about Qelbree (viloxazine) as an ADHD medication:

Qelbree is a novel non-stimulant medication approved for treating ADHD in both children (6+ years) and adults. Here's how it works:

Primary Mechanism:
- Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI)
- Unlike many ADHD medications, it's not a stimulant
- Works by increasing norepinephrine availability in the brain

Key Systems Affected:
1. Noradrenergic System:
- Blocks norepinephrine reuptake transporters
- Increases norepinephrine in synaptic clefts
- Helps with attention, focus, and executive function

2. Serotonergic System:
- Has some modulating effects on serotonin
- May contribute to emotional regulation benefits

Brain Regions Impacted:
- Prefrontal cortex (attention and executive function)
- Anterior cingulate (focus and decision-making)
- Locus coeruleus (arousal and attention)

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect, such as its clinical efficacy compared to other ADHD medications or its side effect profile?
