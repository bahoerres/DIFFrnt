i've got a few accounts with zohomail. they're currently for a domain that i've been messing around with for a couple of years now. ideally i'll get to a point where it's a tech blog that actually generates revenue and then which service i need based on what the cost is won't matter. 

currently. i'm trying to figure out which service package i'm going to need to best suit my use case.. 

all i really want is to be able to open/manage emails without having to log into a bunch of different websites.. using arch linux i have thunderbird set up and would love to keep all of my inboxes there. both on my personal domain, work domains, gmails, whatever it may be. 

what level of service am i going to need to accomplish this? or, what specific feature would i be looking for?

 To manage multiple email accounts from different providers (like Zoho Mail, Gmail, and others) using a single email client like Thunderbird on your Arch Linux system, you're looking for a feature called IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) support.

IMAP allows you to access and manage your emails from multiple devices while keeping everything synchronized. It's the standard protocol for this kind of email management.

For Zoho Mail specifically, here's what you need to know:

1. IMAP support is available in all Zoho Mail plans, including the free tier.

2. The key features you're looking for are:
   - IMAP access
   - POP access (less important, but sometimes useful)
   - SMTP for sending emails

Given this, you can likely accomplish your goal with Zoho Mail's free tier, which includes:
- 5GB storage per user
- 25MB attachment limit
- IMAP, POP, and SMTP access

If you need more storage or other advanced features, you might consider their paid plans, but for basic email management across multiple accounts in Thunderbird, the free tier should suffice.

To set this up:

1. Enable IMAP in your Zoho Mail settings (if not already enabled).
2. Use Zoho Mail's IMAP settings in Thunderbird to add your account.
3. Repeat this process for your other email accounts (Gmail, work emails, etc.).

This way, you can manage all your emails from different providers in one place (Thunderbird) without needing to log into multiple websites.

Would you like more details on how to set this up in Thunderbird, or do you have any other questions about email protocols or Zoho Mail's offerings?
