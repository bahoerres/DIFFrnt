i'd like you to help me streamline my windows startup. there must be  a way that i can have my apps that run at start do so in a user defined order, yeah?

 You're right to think about streamlining your Windows startup process. While Windows doesn't have a built-in feature to explicitly set the order of startup applications, there are a few approaches you can use to influence the startup sequence:

1. Task Scheduler:
   You can create tasks for each application and set them to run at startup with specific delays. This allows you to control the order indirectly.

2. Startup folder:
   Place shortcuts to your applications in the Startup folder, renamed with numbers to influence the order (e.g., "01_App1.lnk", "02_App2.lnk").

3. Registry editing:
   Modify the "Run" and "RunOnce" keys in the Windows Registry to control startup order, but this requires caution and technical knowledge.

4. Third-party software:
   Some startup managers offer more granular control over the startup sequence.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these methods or provide step-by-step instructions for a specific approach?

on the first page when creating a task in task scheduler there's a spot for location.. what is the significance of that section?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-17 02:19:31 UTC

 The "Location" field in the Task Scheduler is actually not on the first page when creating a task, but it's an important detail to clarify. You might be referring to the "Browse" button on the first page, which allows you to select a program or script to run.

However, there is a "Location" field in the Task Scheduler, and it's found in the "General" tab when editing a task's properties. This field is significant for the following reasons:

1. Security context: It specifies which computer the task should run on. By default, it's set to the local computer.

2. Remote task management: If you're managing tasks across a network, you can set this to a remote computer's name or IP address.

3. Task portability: It helps in identifying where a task should run if you're exporting/importing tasks between computers.

4. Troubleshooting: It's useful for verifying that a task is configured to run on the intended machine.

For most personal use cases where you're setting up tasks on your own computer, you typically don't need to modify this field. It's more relevant in network administration scenarios.

If you're looking to control the startup order of your applications, you'll want to focus more on the "Triggers" tab (to set when the task runs) and the "Actions" tab (to specify what program to run) when creating your tasks. Would you like more information on how to set these up to control your startup sequence?

you're right. the general tab is the first one when i pull up properties.

 Thank you for the clarification. You're absolutely correct, and I appreciate you pointing that out. The General tab is indeed the first one you see when you open the properties of a task in Task Scheduler.

Since we're looking at the General tab, let's focus on the key elements there that are relevant to controlling your startup apps:

1. Name and Description: These help you identify and organize your tasks.

2. Security options: These determine which user account the task runs under and whether it runs when the user is logged on.

3. Configure for: This dropdown lets you choose the version of Windows you're using, which can affect task behavior.

To control the startup order using Task Scheduler, you'll mainly be working with two other tabs:

1. Triggers: Here, you'll set the task to run at startup by choosing "At log on" or "At startup" as the trigger.

2. Actions: This is where you specify the program to run.

To influence the order, you can use the "Delay task for" option in the Triggers tab. By setting different delay times for each app, you can control their startup sequence.

Would you like me to walk you through the process of setting up a startup task with a specific delay to help control your startup order?

task scheduler is resulting in some odd behavior, glazewm is running, but not displaying, and not grabbing keybinds/shortcuts or windows for that matter.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-17 02:42:58 UTC

 I see you're experiencing issues with GlazeWM through Task Scheduler. This is not uncommon, as window managers and other system-level utilities can sometimes behave unexpectedly when launched through Task Scheduler. Let's troubleshoot this:

1. Run level: GlazeWM might need to run with elevated privileges. In the task properties, under the "General" tab, make sure "Run with highest privileges" is checked.

2. User session: Ensure the task is set to run only when the user is logged on. This is also in the "General" tab.

3. Startup delay: Try adding a longer delay in the trigger settings. Sometimes, window managers need other system components to be fully loaded first.

4. Direct execution: Instead of using Task Scheduler, you could try placing a shortcut to GlazeWM in the Startup folder:
   `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

5. Command line arguments: If GlazeWM has any command line options for debugging or verbose output, try adding those to see if it provides more information about why it's not functioning correctly.

6. Run as a service: Some window managers work better when run as a Windows service rather than a regular application.

7. Compatibility settings: Right-click on the GlazeWM executable, go to Properties, then the Compatibility tab. Try running it in compatibility mode for an earlier version of Windows.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, we might need to look into GlazeWM's specific requirements or known issues. Would you like to try any of these approaches, or do you have more information about how GlazeWM typically runs on your system?

ahh. it was the user session.. eventho i was logged in as the user that was running the process, it was in a different session, an alternate reality of sorts?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-17 02:46:33 UTC

 You've hit the nail on the head! What you experienced is a common quirk in how Windows manages user sessions and processes.

When you set a task to run "whether user is logged on or not," Windows runs it in a separate, non-interactive session, even if you're logged in. This separate session is indeed like an "alternate reality" as you aptly put it. In this mode:

1. The process runs, but it can't interact with your desktop environment.
2. It doesn't have access to your user profile's environment variables and settings.
3. It can't display windows or grab keyboard shortcuts in your interactive session.

By changing the setting to run only when the user is logged on, you've ensured that GlazeWM runs in your interactive session, where it can:

1. Access your desktop and display windows.
2. Interact with other running applications.
3. Capture and respond to keyboard shortcuts.

This is crucial for applications like window managers that need to deeply integrate with your desktop environment. Good catch on solving this issue! It's a subtle but important distinction in how Windows handles process execution.

Is GlazeWM working as expected now? Or is there anything else you'd like to adjust in your startup configuration?
