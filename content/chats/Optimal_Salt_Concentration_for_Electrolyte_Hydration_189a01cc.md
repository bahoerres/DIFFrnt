Electrolyte supplements have been big these days and I know that a bit of salt in the water (particularly earlier in the day/right after waking) is popular in some circles. 

A few questions: 

How much salt per, say 32oz of water? How much of said salted water is beneficial? Is there an amount where it becomes harmful? Let's talk some details.

 You're right that electrolyte supplements and adding salt to water have gained popularity, particularly among athletes and those following certain diets. Let's break down your questions:

1. Salt concentration:
A common recommendation is about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt per 32 oz (1 liter) of water. This provides roughly 500-1000 mg of sodium, which is a good starting point for most people.

2. Beneficial amount:
The beneficial amount varies depending on individual factors such as:
- Activity level
- Climate (hot/humid environments increase sweat loss)
- Diet
- Overall health

For most people, 1-2 liters of lightly salted water per day can be beneficial, especially if they're active or in hot conditions. However, this should be adjusted based on individual needs and should not replace regular water intake.

3. Potential harm:
Excessive salt intake can be harmful. The upper limit where it becomes potentially dangerous depends on various factors, but generally:

- For healthy adults, the recommended daily limit for sodium is about 2,300 mg per day.
- Consuming too much salt water can lead to hypernatremia (excess sodium in the blood), which can cause symptoms like thirst, headache, confusion, and in severe cases, seizures or coma.
- People with certain health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney problems) should be especially cautious and consult their doctor before increasing salt intake.

Additional details:

1. Timing: Drinking salted water in the morning can help replenish electrolytes lost overnight and may aid in hydration throughout the day.

2. Other electrolytes: While sodium is important, a balanced electrolyte drink might also include potassium, magnesium, and calcium.

3. Individual variation: Some people may be more salt-sensitive than others. It's important to listen to your body and adjust accordingly.

4. Food sources: Remember that many foods contain salt, so consider your overall diet when adding salt to water.

5. Quality of salt: Some people prefer using sea salt or himalayan salt for trace minerals, though the difference in mineral content is generally minimal.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this topic?
