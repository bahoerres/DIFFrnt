 I understand you're looking to reduce your online information footprint. This is a growing concern for many people in the digital age. Let me break down some of the options you've mentioned and provide an overview of this topic:

1. DeleteMe:
DeleteMe is a subscription-based service that helps remove your personal information from data broker websites and public records databases. They manually opt you out of various data collection services and provide regular reports on their progress.

2. Incogni:
Similar to DeleteMe, Incogni is a privacy protection service that automates the process of sending data removal requests to data brokers and other companies that collect and sell personal information.

3. Mine:
Mine is a slightly different service. It focuses on helping you discover which companies have your personal data and assists you in exercising your "right to be forgotten" under privacy laws like GDPR. It scans your email to identify services you've interacted with and helps you request data deletion from those companies.

General approaches to reducing your online information:

1. Data Broker Opt-Outs: 
   Many data brokers allow you to opt out of their services manually. This can be time-consuming but is free.

2. Search Engine Results:
   You can request removal of outdated or sensitive information from search engines like Google.

3. Social Media Privacy:
   Review and tighten privacy settings on all your social media accounts.

4. Limit Information Sharing:
   Be cautious about what personal information you share online and with whom.

5. Use Privacy-Focused Services:
   Consider using services that prioritize user privacy for email, browsing, and other online activities.

6. Regular Online Presence Audits:
   Periodically search for your name and personal information to see what's publicly available.

It's important to note that completely removing all your information from the internet is extremely difficult, if not impossible. These services and strategies can help reduce your digital footprint, but they require ongoing effort as new information constantly appears online.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of online privacy or these services?
