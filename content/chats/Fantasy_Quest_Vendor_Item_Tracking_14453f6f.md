Vendor
Fantasy Quest players want a way to track what items they purchased from the vendor, how much it cost, and what they still need to purchase from their tracked items list.
Assignment
Complete the calculate_total function.
Inputs
    items_purchased: A list of the names of items purchased. This is a list of strings.
    pinned_list: A list of the names of items the player has 'pinned' and wanted to purchase. This is also a list of strings.
Outputs
The function should return 3 values in this order:
    unpurchased_items: A list of all the item names in pinned_list that weren't found in items_purchased in order.
    receipt: A dictionary containing all the items the player purchased, even stuff not on their list. The keys are the item names and the values are their respective prices from the item_prices dictionary.
    total: The total cost of all the items that were purchased.
Return each value separately, not in a list. For example:
return item1, item2, item3
Tip
You can combine the not negation keyword with in membership operator: if item not in some_list:

 Certainly! I'll provide the Python code for the `calculate_total` function based on your assignment description. I'll make sure to keep it at an appropriate level for an entry-level course while solving the problem effectively.

<antThinking>This code is a good candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be modified or iterated upon by the user. It's a new request, so I'll create a new artifact with the identifier "vendor-calculate-total".</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="vendor-calculate-total" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="python" title="Fantasy Quest Vendor - calculate_total function">
def calculate_total(items_purchased, pinned_list):
    # Dictionary of item prices
    item_prices = {
        "health potion": 5,
        "mana potion": 7,
        "iron sword": 20,
        "leather armor": 15,
        "magic wand": 30,
        "bow": 25,
        "arrows": 1
    }

    # Initialize the output variables
    unpurchased_items = []
    receipt = {}
    total = 0

    # Check for unpurchased items from the pinned list
    for item in pinned_list:
        if item not in items_purchased:
            unpurchased_items.append(item)

    # Create receipt and calculate total
    for item in items_purchased:
        if item in item_prices:
            price = item_prices[item]
            receipt[item] = price
            total += price

    return unpurchased_items, receipt, total
</antArtifact>

This code implements the `calculate_total` function as per the assignment requirements. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

1. We start by defining the `item_prices` dictionary, which contains the prices for various items.
2. We initialize the output variables: `unpurchased_items` (list), `receipt` (dictionary), and `total` (integer).
3. We iterate through the `pinned_list` to find items that weren't purchased and add them to `unpurchased_items`.
4. We then iterate through `items_purchased` to create the receipt and calculate the total cost.
5. Finally, we return the three required values: `unpurchased_items`, `receipt`, and `total`.

This implementation should work correctly with the provided test code. Let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions about the code!
