The Unity is an extremely powerful\nsingular box that essentially allows you to take over the world\nand make it your own. We are not necessarily shooting for world\ndomination, but we are shooting to conquer a worldwide lack\nof muscular development and strength. We will beat puniness\nand weakness once and for all as we combine bodybuilding and\npowerlifting to form the ultimate “Unity”.\nFROM JOHN\nI remember walking into the gym for the first time at 12 years old\nin 1984. I had been training in our home basement with old plastic\nweights doing my best to imitate the routines of Lee Haney, Tom\nPlatz, and others. Any training routine I read about in Muscle\nand Fitness, I tried. When I walked into that gym the first thing\nI saw was a guy they called big Mike doing EZ bar lying triceps\nextensions with two 45 lb. plates on each side. Wow, that looked\ninsane. Then I saw another guy, big Gary, benching 365, which\nseemed like a ton to me. I quickly figured out the biggest guys in\nthe gym, were also the strongest. As I got older and eventually\nwent to college, I joined World Gym East. It was a legendary gym\nthat just about all the best local bodybuilders trained at. There I\nmet the local legends Nick Bowman, Mark O’Hara, and others. They\nall did both powerlifting and bodybuilding. They were good at both\ntoo. They took me under their wing and began to teach me what\npowerlifting was. I still remember them having me deadlift for the\nfirst time in my life there (I did 500!).\n\n4\nBeing in Columbus I was lucky enough to run into people who\nwere training at Westside Barbell as well. Westside is obviously\nlegendary and only open to a select few. When the opportunity\ncame for me to train there, I gladly took it! Now I would be\ntraining alongside the best powerlifters in the world! I soaked up\neverything Louie taught me, as well as all the other lifters. I never\nreally said much, I was too interested in learning and hearing what\nthey liked to do.\nIt was incredible. I would train at Westside on the west side of\nColumbus, and then get in my beater of a car (Renault Alliance with\na bent frame) and race back over to the East side to train at Worlds.\nIt was not uncommon for me to do my squat workout at Westside,\nthen call some friends and have them load the leg press up for\nme at Worlds. When I arrived there I would walk straight to the\nleg press and get busy. While at Westside I also met a guy named\nDave Tate who would have a tremendous influence on my career.\nI got an e-mail from Dave back around 2000 asking me to assist\nhim with some bodybuilding specific training. I traded my first ever\nwritten training program (Pain and Suffering) to Dave for some\nnew chains that I could incorporate into my training. Man, I was\nso excited to get those chains! I ended up training with Dave that\nweekend, and the rest was history. We continued to train together,\nand when I tell you we trained hard, we trained at a level I have\nrarely seen. We were always incorporating elements of both\npowerlifting and bodybuilding into what we were doing. This isn’t\ntheory for us, we lived it, for decades! I ended up winning my IFBB\npro card in bodybuilding training there, and I do not believe I would\nhave been able to do this without Dave. He was instrumental in my\ndevelopment not just physically, but mentally.\nDave and I began talking about doing this program for you all back\nin the first quarter of 2020. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 we did\nnot pursue it, as people just didn’t have access to gyms for a long\n\n5\ntime. Not all do now, but we are tired of waiting and wanted to\nmove forward with this project.\nSome of what you will see in this program is what Dave and I\nwould do. Some of what we did probably won’t make it into the\nprogram, as we did go overboard on occasion (many times – ha).\nI hope you enjoy this. Dave and I are especially appreciative of all\nyour support over the years, and we hope to continue to assist you\nin your efforts to achieve your personal best!\nFROM DAVE\nReading over John’s introduction brought back many memories.\nIt reminded me how we had traveled the same journey, albeit on\ndifferent paths.\nI was introduced to strength training around the same age\n(and time) as John. Three hours away, in a small Ohio town, my\nwrestling coach pushed us through a series of movements using a\nuniversal machine. Not a good athlete (at the time), I was stronger\nthan everyone else... and I loved it, and not long after, I received a\nweight set for Christmas. I didn’t ask for it, never expected it, and\nhad no idea how it would completely change my life trajectory.\nIt didn’t take long for my father to see my passion for training and\ngetting into trouble. These two passions led him to reach out to a\nsmall private barbell club owner in town. He also happened to be\non the local Police force, so my father saw this as a way to keep me\nin line and feed my passion for training.\nThis is where I was introduced to the sport of powerlifting. I was\n13 years old and loved it. It was tough to find information on\nPowerlifting back then. All the magazines and books you could see\nwere on bodybuilding (and I read them all). If you were lucky, there\nmight have been one article or one section on powerlifting. What\nI was learning about strength and the sport of powerlifting was\n\n6\n100% in the trenches from many lifters who (for some unknown\nreason) took the time out to help me. The learning-disabled kid\nwith low grades and a not-so-right attitude. The training gave me\nsomething I could control. The harder I trained, the more control\nI had, the more respect I gained, the greater my confidence grew,\nand the better athlete I became.\nIt changed my life.\nIn all of my years under the bar, I have had to fight and find balance.\nNot the balance most people speak about but the “training hard”\nbalance. There are different types of “training hard”. On one\nextreme, you have the heavy max effort work, and on the other\nside, you have what John would call challenge sets. I LOVE both of\nthese, but they conflict with each other (badly). You have to recover\nfrom your training and what you do needs to lead to the desired\nresults. As a competitor, you get to a point where you need to pick\nyour battles, leave ego at the door, and train to get better. This is\nthe balance I struggled with. Strangely, there were many times I\nwould train my ass into the ground, knowing full well it would hurt\nmy performance in the end. I was okay with this and have paid the\nprice for it.\nIf you are like this, trust me, I “get it”. Very few people ever will.\nI think this was part of the reason I reached out to John in\n2010. I knew his reputation and remembered him from his time\nat Westside. Most (amongst all) of the people I’ve consulted\nwith post-2005 (when I stopped competing) recommended or\nsuggested I dial it back.\nDial back what? I would ask. Dial back the heavy triples and singles,\nor dial back the all-out challenge sets?\nI was always told, both.\n\n7\nTo me, that made me question why train at all.\nAll these intentions were coming from the right place and not\naltogether wrong. I had more than two decades competing and\npushing my body over the edge (I have wear and tear to validate this).\nPart of me thought John would understand this. The other part of\nme wanted to know if he really trained as hard as I read and was\ntold. It’s one thing to talk about the “I train hard” game, and it’s\nanother to do It.\nWe all think we train really hard until you train with someone who\ntrains harder than you.\nAfter that first leg session, I knew this was exactly what I was\nlooking for, and part of me wanted to see if he would quit. Shortly\nafter, I believe he felt the same thing about me, and things began\nto get insane.\nIf there was an edge, we crossed it, adapted to it, found another\nedge, and so on. This would have kept going, and I can only\nspeculate how far, but there is always a point of diminishing\nreturns. While my competitive days were behind me, John was\ntaking a final run at his pro card. Some things were not worth the\nrisk, not just in injury but recovery.\nAs we used to joke, we had to find a way to better structure and\ncontrol all the “stupid shit.”\nI also began to miss the heavy, heavy singles. At this point in John’s\ncareer, these had little to no value, but I love those more than he\nwould like “chasing the pump.”\nRemember, the same passion for training intensity but two\ndifferent journeys.\n\n8\nFor a couple of years, we just stacked things on top of each\nother. Then we had to find a way to blend them all into a scheme\nthat would satisfy the training passion but allow for long-term\nadaption and progression.\nWhen John suggested we develop this program, I was all in. The\nmain reason was we now have all components I feel make this\nvaluable. We lived it. We took things too far, dialed back, dialed\nback too far, found the right balance only to have it screw up again.\nWe figured it out by trial and error over many years.\nWe have also been removed enough from it to look back critically.\nThis is more important than most people think because you only\nsee what you want to see when you are too close. This bias makes\nit harder to think about how what you are suggesting can be used\nby others most positively. Case in point, you ever notice how most\ntrainers and coaches HIGHLY recommend their clients and followers\ndo exactly what they are doing at the time? Think about it.\nThis brings us to this program.\n\n9\nWHAT IS POWERBUILDING?\nPowerbuilding simply means combing some aspects of\npowerlifting and bodybuilding together. Generally, this will mean:\n• Using the big 3 lifts as the foundation of the program – squat,\nbench, deadlift\n• Max effort work - Incorporating specific heavy lower rep\nrange targets more common to powerlifting\n• Dynamic effort work - Incorporating some medium weight\ndynamic speed work that powerlifters use for rate of force\ndevelopment\n• Using isolation work that is more common for bodybuilders\n• Using more of a variety of movements in order to achieve\nmaximal development of each muscle group common for both\npowerlifters and bodybuilders\n• Incorporating medium to high rep pump work more specific to\nbodybuilding\nCombine all this intelligently, and you get powerbuilding.\nMAX EFFORT WORK\nPart of our program will consist of max effort work. If you have not\ndone this before, you are in for a treat. Max effort work generally\nmeans you are going to work up to 90% of your 1 rep max for 1\nrepetition. After this you are going to attempt a 100% rep. In other\nwords, do the best you can do. The goal being a PR. We have a\nlittle different view on this through our experiences. We will not be\ndoing heavy singles weekly. It is not necessary. We will do some\nlower rep sets however, that will be very heavy.\nIt will become extremely important that you use perfect form to\navoid injury. We have included multiple technique videos to ensure\nyou have the know how to accomplish this. You will also see where\n\n10\nwe advise you to simply hold a weight for a few seconds before\nstarting a set, and then holding it again for a few seconds before\nracking the weights.\nYou will be warming up well, and our pre-max bodybuilding\nexercises will also serve to protect you as you go all out.\nWe will use some rotation on this exercise(s) to ensure:\n• Weak areas are addressed\n• You avoid accommodation (your body’s nervous and muscular\nsystem adapting to the same exercises over and over)\n• Longevity as keeping the same exercises with no rotation\noften results in injury\nThe max effort method ensures maximal motor unit recruitment as\nwell, but more on that later.\nBuilding maximal strength goes a long way in many different\naspects. The obvious thing is that you will get physically stronger.\nYou can push more weight, drag more weight, etc. If you can\nmove more weight, you will generally develop more muscle\nfiber size through increasing levels of mechanical tension. Bigger\nmuscles (larger muscle fibers) can potentially produce more force.\nBottom line, more strength can create more muscle. It’s a win-\nwin. You will see this especially in the beginner to intermediate\nphases of training. It will get tougher as you enter the advanced\nstages of training, which could be 10 years or more into training.\nUnfortunately, you can’t get infinitely stronger.\nDYNAMIC WORK\nPart of our program will also consist of dynamic work. With this\nmethod, you will be using much lighter weight, probably closer to\n55-75% of your 1 rep max. By itself, it will not make you big, but\ncarefully woven into your program, it will make you explosive.\n\n11\nThis method is specifically to improve your rate of force\ndevelopment. In other words, produce force, a lot of it, and fast. This\nis particularly useful for athletes. The best athletes are explosive\nand can produce force very quickly. We want you to be explosive,\nso you can push more weight. This is also useful for conditioning.\nYou will be doing a phase where the volume of your dynamic work\nramps up in order to accomplish this. This type of work is also, well,\nfun! It is enjoyable blasting the weight up explosively.\nFor your dynamic work you will be using a percentage of your\n1 rep maximum.\nCALCULATING YOUR 1 REP MAXIMUM\nRep Max Calculator - All Things Gym\nUsing this link, you will be able to calculate your 1 rep maximum.\nThis is a really cool tool. It shows you your max based on all the\ndifferent formulas out there. You DO NOT have to do a 1 rep max.\nYou can do your 5 rep max and enter the number and it will give\nyou a guesstimate. We would suggest doing something like a 3 or\neven 5 rep max to get your number.\nLet’s take a look.\nBelow I entered 400\nfor 3 reps. Go down\nto the 3RM and\nyou will see this.\nAcross the top you\nsee all the different\nformulas and their\ncalculation for the\n1 rep max. We want\nyou to use the\nlowest number. In\nthis case it would be\n\n12\nthe Brzycki result which says a 423 max. Is this the most accurate?\nMaybe, maybe not. We simply want to be conservative here as went\nextremely aggressive in our progressions through the program as\nyou will soon see.\nBODYBUILDING METHOD\nWe will also be using traditional bodybuilding methods. Typically,\nthis consists of 75-85% of your 1 rep max loads done to failure\nor close to it. Many times, we also finish an exercise with a high\nintensity technique that actually takes you beyond failure. This\nwork is very demanding and will require you to have hyper focus\non recovery so that you don’t overtrain.\nLOG BOOKING AND PROGRESSIONS\nThis program is going to lay out some very aggressive progressions\nfor you week to week. The progressions will always be in bold type.\nThis is an example. In week 2 you add 2 more reps to your working\nsets than you did in week 1 using the same weight.\nLeg press – Use a narrow stance with your feet in the middle\nof the platform. This is going to hit your quads hard. Do a few\nwarm up sets then 2 tough sets of 12 using the same weight\nyou did last week for 10. Use the same weight as last week\nbut try to get 2 additional reps. 2 total work sets\nFull transparency here. We do not expect you to hit every single\nprogression. What we do expect, is for you to give it your all. Give\nevery single bit of effort you can muster. That is what we expected\nfrom each other, and what we expect from you. We held ourselves\nto a high standard, and this also applies to you. Even if you hit only\n25% of these, you will come a long way by the end.\nKnowing this, be sure to use a log book. Old school pen and paper is fine.\nYou don’t have to use a fancy spreadsheet unless that is your preference.\n\n13\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER – THE SCIENCE\nLet’s look at motor unit\nrecruitment. Motor units are\npart of your nervous system and\nthe muscle fibers they talk to.\nThe motor neurons (as seen in\nthe diagram) tell your muscles\nfibers to produce force.\nWe have what we call high\nthreshold motor units (HTMUs)\nand low threshold motor units\n(LTMUs). The HTMUs have larger\nnerve cells that control hundreds of muscle fibers. This means that\nthey produce much more force than a LTMU. This is because the\nLTMUs contain a small nerve cell that drives less muscle fibers.\nIt is also key to understand the “Heneman Size Principle”. This\nstates that motor units are recruited from smallest to largest.\nWhen you use lighter weights, your body will call upon the LTMUs\nfirst. It is not until the body needs to produce high levels of force\nthat the HTMUs are called into action. This is key. You want\nmaximal activation. This simply means you want every possible\nmuscle fiber to fire and produce force.\nWhen you use the max effort method you are using loads that are\nso heavy, your body has to produce as much force as it can. This\nmeans full engagement of LTMUs and HTMUs. This is a good thing.\nWhat about the dynamic effort work? It is lighter so you might\nhave thought to yourself this will not require full activation. You\nwere kind of correct. The key is how explosive you train. In other\nwords, how much effort do you put into driving the bar up. You also\nengage HTMUs when you need to produce maximum force fast.\nIf you push the bar up as fast as you can, you also have maximal\n\n14\nactivation. The same is even true with a vertical leap. If you jump\nas high as you can, with max effort, you do get maximum motor\nunit activation.\nSo, your next question might be, then why don’t we just lift light\nweights fast? Well unfortunately it is not that easy. Muscle growth\nitself, requires mechanical tension. This happens when smaller\nfilaments of muscle called actin and myosin overlap, and a process\ncall cross-bridging occurs. This process enables muscle fibers\nto sort of “lock in” and produce force. When they stay connected,\nthe result is mechanical tension. This results in the potential for\nmuscle growth. If you think about the max effort work, you can\nreally understand this more clearly. You are fighting against the\nheavy weight, grinding to get it up. During this, your actin and\nmyosin filaments are overlapped, and your body is producing\nmaximum force and tension.\nLet’s go back to your original question on light weights. The cross-\nbridge process mentioned works, but the fast velocity of the bar\nmoving up and down causes the “attachments” to detach often.\nThey do not stay connected the throughout the whole set. This\nmeans you do not reach high levels of mechanical tension and\n\n15\ntherefore do not grow. That is why you can’t just jump up and\ndown and get huge quads.\nAgain, the dynamic work does teach you to be explosive and\npowerful though, so the method will help you become your best.\nThe bodybuilding method (medium repetition ranges) also\ncovers this well. The loads are close to what is needed to achieve\nmaximum muscle fiber recruitment, but not all the way. When\nyou perform a set to failure, or especially beyond failure, you are\ncovered though. Here is why. You may not engage all the HTMUs\nfrom the start, but as muscle fibers fatigue, more are called into\nplay to help you perform additional reps. The closer you get to\nfailure, the more you are calling in all the reserve fibers that may not\nhave been engaged from the start. This is why research from well\nrespected researchers like Brad Schoenfeld is showing that lighter\nweight and higher reps can create just as much hypertrophy as\ntraditional bodybuilding reps. Failure, or close to it, is key.\nReality and our experience\nLet’s talk about the application of this a little more. The gold\nnuggets of info are always in the context and application of theory.\nLifting at 85-90% of your 1 rep maximum ensures you have very\nhigh levels of activation as we just learned. This means more\nmuscle fibers will contract.\nThere is a caveat here though.\nIf you like these ranges, and tend to use it exclusively, you are likely\nheaded for trouble. Brad Schoenfeld’s work showed that 3 sets of\n10 and 7 sets of 3 produced similar gains in size. Internet gurus all\ncheered and declared they would now just stick with sets of 3. The\nproblem was after the study concluded, the 7 sets of 3 group were\nbeaten up and battered.\n\n16\nThose of us who know training saw this coming. It is common\nsense really. So, the downside is the risk of injury when only\nfocused on lower rep ranges. It is extremely hard on connective\ntissue and will most certainly cause some injuries down the\nline, possibly even tears. Training with only these ranges is not\nconducive to staying in one piece, nor practical. Having said\nthat, these reps can make you stronger though which does have\nbenefits to overall size, thus we will be careful in application.\nWhat about higher reps? Brad also carried out research on higher\nreps vs traditional reps. In this case sets of 8 -12 vs sets of 25 – 35.\nThe results were that muscle gains were once again very similar.\nNow we have a solution to always staying injury free right? Let’s\nexamine further.\nTo reiterate, lighter loads such as 40-60% mean you will only have\nso much muscle fiber activation initially. You need to produce less\nforce, so less muscle fibers need to be recruited. You will therefore\nneed to exhaust those muscle fibers to call in others to help as the\nearlier engaged fibers fatigue.\nHere comes the reality check.\nWhen you get into these higher reps, there is usually an\naccompanying amount of extreme burning and pain. You will need\nto work through this. You have to get closer to failure in order to\nachieve full motor unit activation as mentioned earlier. Can you\nwork through the burn and get close to failure, or will the burn stop\nyou in your tracks? Can you do it on all sets if training specifically\nin this range? How long can you handle that? The other poignant\nthing to mention is that researchers such as Chris Beardsley are\nshowing that CNS fatigue is likely more due to these higher rep\nsets to failure, than training with heavier loads and lower reps. In\nsummary, this kind of training if done right is extremely painful\nand can be draining. There is a reward though. There is nothing like\n\n17\na skin splitting pump that turns your skin purple and makes your\nveins stand out like roadmaps.\nIn summary, the program in our view should contain a heavy dose\nof traditional bodybuilding reps, but for maximum strength benefit\nand longevity, the other rep ranges need to be included in a well\nthought way.\nTHE SPLIT\nHere is what the training split looks like. If you need to add in an\nextra rest day, feel free. It is very important to recover well from\neach workout. If you recover well, we prefer you follow this model.\nThe hardest days are days 4 and 5 so having 2 days of rest after is\nvery beneficial.\nDay 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7\nLower w/\nDynamic\nUpper Push\nw/ Dynamic \nBack / Pull \nLower w/\nMax Effort\nUpper Push\nw/ Max Effort \nOFF OFF\nRECOVERY NUTRITION\nWith this focus on intensity, and especially the higher volume\ndays on Day 4 and 5, comes the need for hyper focus on recovery\nto get maximum results. We highly recommend using an amino,\nelectrolyte, and carb drink intra for maximum recovery. This will\nstimulate insulin response and you will drive more aminos and\ncarbs into muscle and the recovery process is heightened. It also\nincreases blood flow and supports your immune system FYI.\nMost males would do well with 6-10 grams of essential aminos,\nand 40-50 grams of carbs. Titrate the carbs up or down depending\non your size. The goal is to greatly reduce soreness. When you do\nthis, all of the right things are happening internally.\n\n18\nMost females would do well with 6 grams of aminos and 20-30 of\ncarbs. Again, titrate up or down depending on size and amount of\nmuscle.\nOur product choices are:\nRecovery from Granite Supplements - Recovery | Evidence\nBased Intra Workout Blend | Granite Supplements - Start\nwith one scoop during training. If the body part doesn’t get\nexcessively sore and recovers fast you are good to go. If it still\ngets pretty sore add a scoop of the intra-carb below to it. If it\nstill gets sore add 8 oz of Gatorade in on top of that.\nIntra Carb | High Performance Carbohydrate Blend | Granite\nSupplements\nYou can use code Powerbuilder15 to get 15% off your first order.\nRECOVERY LIFESTYLE\nWith this focus on intensity make it your mission in life to reduce\nstress outside of the gym, and to get a full night’s sleep every\nsingle night. This will greatly enhance recovery as well.\nGenerally, you want to get 5 full sleep cycles. Every cycle is about\n90 minutes. As you can see from the chart below, earlier sleep\ncycles are heavier in non-REM sleep. Later sleep cycles are heavier\nin REM sleep (indicated in red).\nThis is important because of these benefits:\n• Non-REM is physically restorative. You release GH, clear waste\nproducts, and resupply energy stores just to name a few things\n• REM is mentally restorative. Your memory is especially\nimpacted positively\n\n19\n11pm\nCycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 Cycle 4 Cycle 5\nNon-REM stage 3\n(formerly stage 3 & 4)\nNon-REM stage 2\nNon-REM stage 1\nREM sleep\nAwake\n12pm 1am 2am 3am 4am 5am 6am 7am\nSome tips for better sleep include:\n• Turn off all electronics 2 hours before bed, or at a minimum\nturn off the blue light on your mobile devices 1-2 hours prior\n• Make your bedroom as dark as possible\n• Make the temperature in your room around 65̊ (keep it cool)\n• Read a book or do something that relaxes you before retiring\n• Do not take later afternoon naps, 20-30 minute naps around\nlunch are ok\nBAND WORK\nBand work is sprinkled into the program lightly at various points as well.\nHere are the bands you will need from EliteFTS.net if you want to\nincorporate them:\n• 2 orange micro mini band (for face pulls and for women to use\non chest press machines)\n• 2 red long pro minis (for chest presses and pullovers)\n• 1 red short pro mini band (for spidercrawls)\n\n20\n• 1 pro light band for assisted chins, pullovers, and banded good mornings\n• 1 pro average band for assisted chins and banded good mornings\nNUTRITION\nWe wrote this program with the intention of it being used to gain size.\nIf you are looking for a starting point, then try this:\nMultiply your bodyweight x 20 for your total calories.\nFor example, Louie weighs 200 lbs., so this is 4,000 calories daily.\nMultiply your bodyweight x 1.25 for daily grams of protein.\nThe 200 lbs. person thus needs 250 grams of protein daily.\nMultiply your bodyweight x .5 for daily grams of fat.\nThe 200 lbs. person thus needs 100 grams of fat daily.\nThe rest of your calories should be consumed as carbs.\nIn this example, the 250 grams equal 1,000 calories (a gram of\nprotein = 4 calories.)\nThe 100 grams of fat equal 900 calories (a gram of fat = 9 calories.)\n4,000 total calories minus the 1,900 calories from protein and fat\nleaves Louie with 2,100 calories.\n2,100 calories / 4 = 525 grams of carbs. * a gram of carbs equals 4 calories.\nI’ll add another example below for your daily macros.\nOur Hero Bodyweight Total calories Protein Fat Carbs\nLouie 200 4,000 250 100 525\nBrittany 125 2,500 156 63 327\n\n21\nPROPER INTENSITY\nIt is also critical to work at the right level of intensity regarding\ngoing to failure. Going too hard or too easy can compromise\nresults. We have taken the guesswork out of this and will give you\nan “RPE” on exercises that are not percentage based. RPE stands\nfor rate of perceived exertion.\nFollow the RPE suggestion for each exercise to ensure you are\ntraining at the correct intensity level.\nAlso, be sure to watch this video.\n(25) (RPE & RIR) Should You Use Them | My Thoughts - YouTube\nRate of Perceived Exertion Flow Chart\nFairly easy like a warm-up weight @ 6.0\nYou can do 4-6 more reps @ 7.0\nYou can do 2-3 more reps @ 8.0\nYou have 2 more reps left in the tank @ 8.5\nYou have 1 more rep left in the tank @ 9.0\nWent to failure at perfect form @ 10\nWent to failure with loose form after perfect reps completed @ 11\nUsed a high intensity technique to push beyond failure @ 12\nUsed multiple high intensity techniques/go apeshit set! @ 13\nClick on any one of the tags for an example\nGenerally, (not always) I count sets that are 7.0 and above as\nworking sets.\n\n22\n***FEEDER SETS – We will mention feeder sets often in the\nprogram. They are extremely important. These are low rep sets\ndesigned to get you to your working sets carefully, so you do not\nget injured or exhaust your muscles too soon. Not doing these sets\nis why many people have been injured executing low volume/high\nintensity workout plans.

Hanging Leg Raises - 6-10 reps\n2. Plank – 15 seconds\n3. Band Pull Apart with long micro mini band – 15 reps\nDo 3 rounds here.\n1/ Legs | Lying leg curls\nOn dynamic squat days we are going to go hard on our leg\ncurls. This will help your hams grow and will have little to\nno effect on your squat velocity once you get used to them.\nYou will do 3-4 warm up sets and then go right into the high\nintensity set. It will consist of doing 8 reps, then dropping\nthe weight and doing another 8, followed by 10 slow par-\ntials out of the stretch position. 1 total work set\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n50 x 15 – Warm up set\n70 x 12 – Warm up set\n90 x 6 – Feeder set (low rep sets\ndesigned to get you to your top set\nwithout exhausting you)\n110 x 8, 90 x 8, 90 x 10 partials – RPE 13\nRest Period – N/A – only 1 work set\n(17) Lying leg curl with partials\n2/ Legs | Dynamic squats\nToday is dynamic squat day. You are going to use a moder-\nately wide stance. On the leg presses below you will see we\nuse a narrower stance. These two exercises will always be\nthe opposite of each other in set up/stance for overall pow-\ner and muscular development purposes during this phase.\nWe really focus on speed and producing maximum force\nas fast as we can here. These squats will feel light. Keep\nthe rest periods to 30 sec. You will be using a percentage of\nyour 1 rep max squat on these. It is tempting to go heavier,\nbut do not do it. These percentages are set for a reason.\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n135 x 10 – Warm up\n185 x 8 – Warm up\n225 x 4 – Feeder set\n275 for 10 x 2 - This assumes 275 is 55% of\nyour 1 rep max.\nDay 1 – Lower body focusDay 1 – Lower body focus\nAbs 1 exercise 3 sets\nLegs 3 exercises \n13 sets \n(10 of these are\ndynamic speed sets)\nLow back 1 exercise 3 sets\nCalves 1 exercise 3 sets\n6 exercises 22 sets\n\n28\nSave the heavier squats for later in the week. You will be squatting to a parallel box on these.\nThis can be a bench or box or anything else solid. Do not drop onto the box carelessly. Follow\nall the instructions Dave and John demonstrate in the video below carefully. We will be adding\nmore sets of these during this training block as we go. Do 10 sets of 2 here. 10 total work sets\nRest Period – 30 seconds between work sets\nWork set % – 55%\n(16) Dynamic Squats With Dave Tate (How & Why)\n3/ Legs | Leg press\nUse a narrow stance with your feet in the middle of the plat-\nform. This is going to hit your quads hard. Do a few warm up\nsets then 2 tough sets of 10. 2 total work sets\nRest Period – 3 minutes between work sets\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n2 plates per side x 6 – Feeder to get feel of\nmovement\n3 plates per side x 6 – Feeder set\n4 plates per side x 10 – RPE 8\n4 plates per side x 10 – RPE 8\n4/ Low back | Barbell hyperextensions\nDo these nice and slow. They are brutal. Make sure you are\nset up on the pad correctly. You should feel this in your low\nback, hams, and glutes. Do 3 sets of 8. 3 total work sets\nRest Period – 3 minutes between work sets\n(2) Exercise Index - Barbell Hyperextensions\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\nBodyweight x 10 – Warm up\n135 x 8 – RPE 8\n135 x 8 – RPE 8\n135 x 8 – RPE 8\n5/ Abs | Decline leg raise\nWatch the video below for proper form. I’d like to see 3 sets\nof 10 if possible. If this is not possible, just do what you can.\nIf this is too easy, then do 3 sets of 15-20. 3 total work sets\nGoal – Progress weekly on these by adding 1 rep per set.\nRest Period – 1 minute between work sets\nRPE 8-10\nExercise Index - Decline leg raises\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\nWeek 1 – 3 x 10 (30 total reps)\nWeek 2 – 3 x 11 (33 total reps)\nWeek 3 – 3 x 12 (36 total reps)\nWeek 4 – 3 x 13 (39 total reps)\nWeek 5 – 3 x 14 (42 total reps)\nWeek 6 – 3 x 15 (45 total reps)\nWeek 7 – We will rotate out this exercise\n\n29\n6/ Calves | Standing calf raises\nDo 3 heavy sets of 8 here. Work the stretch hard at the bot-\ntom. 3 total work sets\nIn between ALL sets of calves, you will be doing tibialis an-\nterior work. Do sets of 25. See the link below for options on\nhow to do this. This is for every calf workout you do from\nhere on out!\nRest Period – 1 minute between work sets\n(48) Exercise Index - Tibia Raises\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n75 lbs. x 10 – Warm up\n125 x 5 – Feeder\n175 x 8 – RPE 9-10\n175 x 8 – RPE 9-10\n175 x 8 – RPE 9-10\n\n30\nWarm up rotation\n1. Hanging Leg Raises - 6-10 reps\n2. Plank – 15 seconds\n3. Band Pull Apart with long micro mini band – 15 reps\nDo 3 rounds here.\n1/ Chest | Dynamic benches\nToday is dynamic bench day. This means we really focus on\nspeed and producing maximum force as fast as we can. You\nwill be using a percentage of your 1 rep max bench on these.\nIt is tempting to go heavier, but do not do it. These percent-\nages are set for a reason. Use 3 different grips here. We\ndemonstrate this in the video below as well. The first 3 sets\nare with a grip one finger away from the smooth part of the\nbar. The next 3 sets are where your pinky will be on the ring.\nThe last 3 sets your forefinger will be on the ring. Do 9 sets\nof 3 here. 9 total work sets\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n135 x 10 – Warm up\n135 x 10 – Warm up\n185 x 4 – Feeder set\n225 for 9 x 3 - This assumes 225 is 55%\nof your 1 rep max.\nFor work sets use 55% of max weight.\nRest Period – 30 seconds between work sets\nWork set % – 55%\n3 Dynamic Bench Grips (Increase Strength)\nDay 2 – Upper body push focusDay 2 – Upper body push focus\nChest 2 exercises \n11 sets \n(9 of these are\ndynamic speed sets)\nShoulders 2 exercises 5 sets\nTriceps 2 exercise 7 sets\n6 exercises 23 sets\n\n31\n2/ Chest | Slight incline dumbbell press\nI love small angles both incline and decline for chest. Just\nput a 25 under the end of the bench where your head is. If\nyou have a really good adjustable bench, you can do the\nsetting that is a tad higher (more like 15-20 degrees). Do a\nfew warm ups, then low rep feeder sets until you get to your\nbig set. Do about 8 reps there. We’ll then do a 2nd all out set\nthere where you try to match the number, and then drop the\nweight 30% and go to failure. 2 total work sets\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n45’s x 15 – Warm up set\n65’s x 4 – Feeder set\n85’s x 8 – RPE 9\n85’s x 8. Drop to 60’s and go to failure – RPE 12\nRest Period – 3 minutes\n(48) Slight angle dumbell press\n3/ Shoulders | High incline Smith press\nYou should be pretty warmed up but make sure you still\ndo 1-2 feeder sets to get the feel of the angle and weight. I\nwant a tough set of 8 then 5. Please keep form perfect on\nthese sets. Stop just short of failure. No sloppy form al-\nlowed here. Use a medium grip here. For hand placement,\nyour pinkies will go on the rings. 2 total work sets\nRest Period – 3 minutes between work sets\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n95 x 3 – Feeder set\n105 x 4 – Feeder set\n135 x 8 – RPE 8 (Hold the first and last rep\nfor a two count at the top)\n155 x 5 – RPE 9 (Hold the first and last rep\nfor a two count at the top)\n(4) Exercise Index - High Incline Smith Press\n4/ Shoulders | Dumbbell Y raises\nRaise the dumbbells to 10 and 2 o’clock and feel the burn!\nDo 3 sets of 12 here. The key tips in the video are at about 2\nminutes in. 3 total work sets\nRest Period – 2 minutes between work sets\n(41) Exercise Index - Incline Prone Laterals | Less Traps\nand Wider Shoulders\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n20’s x 12 – RPE 9\n20’s x 12 – RPE 9\n20’s x 12 – RPE 9\nNote – If you have had shoulder issues, I would advise adding in Spidercrawls here.\nPro Tip\nStopping an inch or two short of touching your chest will take away significant\nstress from the rotator cuff and keep your shoulders healthier.\n\n32\nSpidercrawls\nWe love these for shoulder health and rear delt pumps. Go-\ning up and down 3 times is 1 set. Go down below the waist\nand come up to over your head. 3 total work sets\nRest Period – 2 minutes between work sets\n(41) Exercise Index - Spider Crawls For Rotator\nCuff health\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\nRed short pro mini band – Up and down 3\ntimes – RPE 9\nRed short pro mini band – Up and down 3\ntimes – RPE 9\nRed short pro mini band – Up and down 3\ntimes – RPE 9\n5/ Triceps | Dual rope triceps extensions\nDo 4 sets of 12 here reaching failure. 4 total work sets\nRest Period – 2 minutes between work sets\n(41) Exercise Index - Dual Rope Tricep Extensions\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n120 lbs. x 12 – RPE 9-10\n120 lbs. x 12 – RPE 9-10\n120 lbs. x 12 – RPE 9-10\n120 lbs. x 12 – RPE 9-10\n6/ Triceps | Dumbbell triceps kickouts\nUse a slow tempo and absolutely perfect form on these. Do\n3 sets of 8. 3 total work sets\nRest Period – 2 minutes between work sets\n(41) Dumbbell Tricep Kickout (Great 4 Growth)\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n30’s x 8 – RPE 9\n30’s x 8 – RPE 9\n30’s x 8 – RPE 9\n\n33\n1/ Back | Chest supported row\nUse a machine that has a chest pad so you can eliminate\nlower back stress. Use a pronated grip (palms facing down).\nThese are meant to target your lower traps, rhomboids, and\nrear delts. Do 3 sets of 8 here. Use a full range of motion\nreally stretching out in the lengthened position.\n3 total work sets\nRest Period – 3 minutes between work sets\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n50 lbs. x 15 – Warm up\n50 lbs. x 10 – Warm up\n90 lbs. x 4 – Feeder set\n140 lbs. x 8 – RPE 9\n140 lbs. x 8 – RPE 9\n140 lbs. x 8 – RPE 9\n(42) Supported Row for a “THICK BACK” Exercise Index\n2/ Back | One arm barbell row\nThe goal here is to work your lats hard. Do two low rep\nfeeder sets to get you to your working weight. Do two hard\nsets of 10 to start. Next up is your money set. Do around\n10, where 10 is failure. If you do 9 or 11, that’s ok, we just\nneed that last rep to be failure with good form. If you get 12\nor more, you didn’t go heavy enough. After you do your 10,\ndrop the weight 25-30% and grind out as many more reps\nas you can. Treat your arms as simple attachments, do not\npull with your biceps. 3 total work sets\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\n50 x 5 – Feeder set\n75 x 5 – Feeder set\n100 x 10 – RPE 10\n100 x 10 – RPE 10\n100 x 10, then 75 x 10 – RPE 12\n*It is ok if you lose a few reps on these, as fatigue may start to set in.\nRest Period – 3 minutes between work sets\n(41) One Arm Barbell Row Great Back “THICKENER” (Exercise Index)\nDay 3 – Upper body pull focusDay 3 – Upper body pull focus\nBack 3 exercises 9 sets\nRear delts 1 exercise 3 sets\nBiceps 2 exercises 6 sets\n6 exercises 18 sets\n\n34\n3/ Back | Banded pull ups\nDo 3 sets to failure here. See the video below on ex-\nactly how to do these. Most people use the long or-\nange light band for these. If you are strong at these,\nyou might use a long red pro mini band. If you can, try\nto get a really good lat stretch at the bottom and make\nsure you drive up as high as you can. You will feel a\nvery unique pump in that upper and outer lat/teres\narea that is awesome. On the last set, hold your last\nrep in the middle part of the range of motion (isohold)\nfor as long as you can. 3 total work sets\nThis is an example of what it could look like:\nPullups to failure – RPE 10\nPullups to failure – RPE 10\nPullups to failure, isohold at midrange for as long\nas possible – RPE 12\nRest Period – 2 minutes between work sets\n(41) Exercise Inedex - Banded Pull Up\n4/ Rear delts | Machine rear delt flyes\nDo 3 sets of 30 here.

Do 3 sets of 5 working your way\nup with dumbbells. These are meant to be easy, and not\nbrutal. However, the work set will be brutal. You will use the\ndumbbells that you used working up for a drop set. Each\nset will involve 8 reps ending with an 8 second isohold\nthen dropping the weight. If you do the isohold right it will\nfeel like a knife going into your glute. See the rep scheme\nand video below for all the details. Make sure you rest 3\nminutes before doing the 2nd leg.

 I'll create tables for both upper push days from Phase 1 (Day 2 and Day 5) based on a 1RM bench of 195 lbs.

<antThinking>This is a good case for an artifact as it's a structured table with detailed workout information that needs to be clearly formatted and could be referenced later. The content is substantial enough to warrant separation from the conversation.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="phase1-upper-push" type="text/markdown" title="Phase 1 Upper Push Days">
## Day 2 - Upper Push (Dynamic Focus)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------|------|--------------|------|
| Dynamic Bench Press | 9 | 3 | 107 lbs (55% 1RM)<br>- Sets 1-3: 1 finger from smooth<br>- Sets 4-6: pinky on ring<br>- Sets 7-9: forefinger on ring | 30 sec |
| Slight Incline DB Press | 2 | 8 | Set 1: Work up to heavy 8<br>Set 2: Same weight + drop set (30% reduction) | 3 min |
| High Incline Smith Press | 2 | 8, 5 | Set 1: 8 reps (2 sec hold first/last rep)<br>Set 2: 5 reps (2 sec hold first/last rep) | 3 min |
| DB Y Raises | 3 | 12 | Focus on 10 & 2 o'clock positions | 2 min |
| Dual Rope Tricep Extensions | 4 | 12 | All sets to failure | 2 min |
| DB Tricep Kickouts | 3 | 8 | Slow tempo, perfect form | 2 min |

## Day 5 - Upper Push (Max Effort Focus)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------|------|--------------|------|
| Slight Decline DB Press | 2 | 8 | Set 1: Work up to heavy 8<br>Set 2: Same weight + drop set (30% reduction) | 3 min |
| High Incline Bench Press | 3 | 3, 2, 2 | Set 1: Heavy triple<br>Sets 2-3: 80% 1RM (156 lbs)<br>3 count negative | 2 min |
| Dumbbell Press | 2 | 8 | Set 1: Work to heavy 8<br>Set 2: Same weight + drop set | 3 min |
| Dips | 3 | 8-10 | Add weight if able<br>Use assist machine if needed | 3 min |
| DB Side Lateral Partials | 3 | 20 | High volume, swinging form allowed | 2 min |
| Machine Rear Delt Flyes | 3 | 15 | Moderate weight for higher reps | 2 min |
| Kettlebell Tate Press | 4 | 12 | All sets to failure<br>Can substitute DBs if needed | 2 min |
| DB Lying Extensions | 3 | 8 | Performed on floor<br>Pause at bottom | 2 min |

Notes:
- Dynamic bench weight calculated as 55% of 195 lb 1RM = 107 lbs
- For dumbbell exercises, start light and work up based on feel/RPE
- 2-second holds prescribed for certain movements help build strength and control
- Rest periods are guidelines, adjust based on recovery needs
</antArtifact>

The program structures the two push days quite differently:
- Day 2 focuses on explosive dynamic work and moderate volume
- Day 5 emphasizes maximal strength with heavier weights and more overall volume

Would you like me to explain any of the specific movements or concepts in more detail?

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 17:47:06 UTC

 Yes! Let me break down Day 3 (Upper Pull) from Phase 1 into a similar format.

<antThinking>For consistency and clarity, creating another table in the same style as the push days will be helpful, especially given the detailed sets, reps, and progression scheme.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="phase1-upper-pull" type="text/markdown" title="Phase 1 Upper Pull Day">
## Day 3 - Upper Pull

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------|------|--------------|------|
| Chest Supported Row | 3 | 8 | Pronated grip (palms down)<br>Full range of motion<br>Focus on lower traps & rhomboids<br>Increase weight weekly | 3 min |
| One Arm Barbell Row | 3 | 10 | First 2 sets: Heavy sets of 10<br>Final set: 10 reps + drop set (25-30% reduction)<br>Focus on lats, minimize bicep involvement | 3 min |
| Banded Pull-ups | 3 | AMRAP | Orange light band for most<br>Red pro mini for stronger lifters<br>Last set: Hold mid-range until failure<br>Focus on lat stretch at bottom | 2 min |
| Machine Rear Delt Flyes | 3 | 30 | High rep focus for rear delt development<br>Push through the burn | 3 min |
| Incline DB Hammer Curls | 3 | 10+5 | 10 full reps + 5 partial reps from bottom<br>One warm-up set before working sets | 2 min |
| Preacher Curls | 3 | 8 | Close to failure<br>Strict form<br>Slow controlled tempo | 2 min |

Key Training Notes:
- Program emphasizes both vertical and horizontal pulling
- Mix of strength and pump work with varied rep ranges
- Heavy focus on rear delt development for shoulder health
- Designed to complement the push days
- Progressive overload through weight increases and/or additional reps weekly

Exercise Tips:
- For chest supported rows, use a machine with a chest pad to eliminate lower back stress
- On one arm barbell rows, treat arms as "hooks" to maximize lat engagement
- Banded pull-ups should include full stretch at bottom and high pull at top
- High rep rear delt work is intentional for shoulder health and bench press stability
</antArtifact>

This pull day is designed to:
1. Balance out the pushing volume
2. Build back thickness and width
3. Develop rear delts for shoulder health
4. Target biceps after the compound movements

Would you like me to explain any specific exercises or the reasoning behind the structure of the pull day?

**Human** - 2024-11-18 17:47:06 UTC

Huh. Is there an upper pull day?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:26:55 UTC

one arm barbell row?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:26:55 UTC

 Let me show you what John means by a one-arm barbell row. It's actually quite a unique and effective variation of the traditional dumbbell row.



<antArtifact identifier="one-arm-barbell-row" type="text/markdown" title="One Arm Barbell Row Technique Guide">
# One Arm Barbell Row (John Meadows Style)

## Setup
- One end of the barbell is placed in a corner or landmine attachment
- Stand straddling the bar near the loaded end
- Hinge forward at hips, keeping back straight
- Grasp the loaded end of the bar with one hand
- Your arm should be hanging straight down

## Key Points
1. Position: 
   - Stand facing the length of the bar
   - Feet in wide stance for stability
   - Bent over position similar to a dumbbell row

2. Grip:
   - Hold the loaded end of the barbell
   - Thumb can wrap around sleeve collar
   - Bar end should sit in palm

3. Movement:
   - Pull bar up by driving elbow back
   - Keep elbow close to body
   - Focus on engaging lats, not biceps
   - Control descent back to start

## Benefits
- The bar path is more stable than dumbbells
- Allows for heavier loading safely
- Fixed path helps reduce cheating
- Great for lat engagement due to angle
- Easier on lower back than traditional barbell rows

## Common Mistakes
- Standing too close to pivot point
- Pulling with biceps instead of back
- Not maintaining bent-over position
- Rotating torso during pull

## Programming Notes
In the Unity program:
- 2 heavy sets of 10
- 1 final set with dropset
- 3 minutes rest between sets
- Focus on form over weight
</antArtifact>

This is one of John Meadows' signature movements. The advantage of using a barbell this way is that it creates a unique pulling angle that really targets the lats while being easier on the lower back than traditional barbell rows. It also allows for heavier loading than dumbbells while maintaining good form.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of this exercise or how it fits into the overall pull day structure?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:27:21 UTC

okay, it's like a one armed t-bar row?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:27:21 UTC

 Yes, exactly! It's essentially a one-arm t-bar row but using a standard barbell (either in a corner or landmine attachment) rather than a dedicated t-bar machine. You've nailed it.

John actually popularized this variation - many people now call it the "Meadows Row" in the bodybuilding community. The key difference from a traditional t-bar row is:

1. Using one arm instead of two
2. Standing to the side rather than straddling directly over the bar
3. Often allows a bit more range of motion since you're not restricted by the bar hitting your chest

The movement is much simpler than my detailed breakdown might have suggested - if you've done one-arm t-bar rows, you'll feel right at home with these. The main benefit is you can do them in any gym with just a barbell, even if they don't have a t-bar machine.

Would you like me to explain any other exercises from the pull day that might not be immediately familiar?

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:28:22 UTC

ahh. the meadows row.. there was another one i was curious about.. Tate Press i think? must be one of Dave's wacky inventions.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:28:22 UTC

 Exactly right! The Tate Press is indeed named after Dave Tate. It's a triceps exercise he created that's become particularly popular among powerlifters for building lockout strength on bench press.

Let me explain this somewhat unique movement:



<antArtifact identifier="tate-press-guide" type="text/markdown" title="Tate Press Technique Guide">
# Tate Press (Kettlebell or Dumbbell)

## Basic Setup
- Lie on a flat bench
- Hold weights (kettlebells or dumbbells) over your chest
- Start position is similar to the top of a dumbbell press

## Unique Movement Pattern
1. Starting Position:
   - Weights held together at top position
   - Palms facing each other
   - Arms fully extended

2. The Press:
   - Lower the weights by bringing your elbows DOWN toward your ribcage
   - Keep upper arms relatively still (unlike a skull crusher)
   - Weights will trace an arc down toward your shoulders
   - Weights should end up near your shoulders/upper chest
   - Your elbows should point outward at the bottom

3. The Return:
   - Press weights back up in the same arc
   - Movement looks like you're "pulling apart" a deck of cards
   - Focus on triceps contraction throughout

## Key Points
- Not a skull crusher - elbows move down, not back
- Keep elbows pointed out, not tucked
- Movement is more of an arc than a straight line
- Can be done with kettlebells (preferred) or dumbbells

## Programming in Unity
- 4 sets of 12
- Focus on feeling triceps throughout
- Use moderate weight with perfect form
- 2 minutes rest between sets

## Why It Works
- Unique angle hits all three heads of triceps
- Particularly effective for bench press lockout
- Keeps constant tension on triceps
- Less elbow stress than traditional extensions
</antArtifact>

The Tate Press is definitely one of Dave's "wacky" but effective inventions. It sits somewhere between a skull crusher and a traditional triceps extension, but with a unique movement pattern that particularly targets the lateral head of the triceps.

Dave created it specifically to help with bench press lockout strength, but it's become popular among bodybuilders too because of how effectively it isolates the triceps.

Would you like me to explain any other exercises that are unique to Dave or John's training style?

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:29:56 UTC

it sounds.. almost like  a barrel press? or scoop flyes?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:29:56 UTC

 Ah! Yes, the movement pattern is somewhat similar to a dumbbell pullover (barrel press) or a Svend press, but moving vertically rather than horizontally. And yes, it has that similar "scooping" motion you'd see in exercises like scoop flyes.

Dave Tate has actually addressed this comparison before - the key difference is the focus on keeping the elbows pointed outward and bringing them down toward the ribcage, rather than back toward the head (like a skull crusher) or in a pure arc (like a pullover).

Think about it kind of like you're:
1. Holding two drinks at chest level
2. Trying to pour them out to your sides
3. But your elbows lead the movement downward
4. And you're lying on your back

The "pouring out" visualization helps explain why kettlebells work particularly well for this movement - the weight distribution makes that pouring motion feel more natural.

It's one of those exercises that looks a bit odd until you try it, but then the triceps engagement becomes immediately apparent. Like many of Dave's innovations, it came from trying to solve a specific problem (in this case, bench press lockout strength) and turned into a generally useful movement.

Would you like me to compare it more specifically to other similar triceps movements, or explain how it fits into the overall pressing scheme in the program?

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:31:49 UTC

i'll check youtube. i'm also looking at the program that Joe Bennett did with Ben Pollack to see if i can pull anything from there.. I'd love to put together a 4 day routine, with an optional 5th (additional arm-focused/shoulder health/mobility accessories)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:31:49 UTC

 That's a great approach! A 4-day split with an optional 5th day for arms/prehab work can be really effective. Let me help you think through this.

The Unity program uses a somewhat unique 5-day split:
- Day 1: Lower (Dynamic)
- Day 2: Upper Push (Dynamic)
- Day 3: Upper Pull
- Day 4: Lower (Max Effort)
- Day 5: Upper Push (Max Effort)

For a 4+1 setup, we could reorganize this into something like:

1. Main 4 Days:
- Lower Body
- Upper Body Push
- Lower Body
- Upper Body Pull

2. Optional 5th Day:
- Arms
- Rear delts/upper back
- Shoulder health work (face pulls, YTWLs, band work)
- Mobility work

The hypertrophy coach (Joe Bennett) tends to focus more on:
- Controlled tempos
- More isolation work
- Less focus on dynamic effort
- More attention to peak contraction
- Careful exercise selection for biomechanics

Would you like me to:
1. Break down potential structures for the 4 main days?
2. Suggest content for the optional 5th day?
3. Look at ways to incorporate principles from both programs?

Let me know which aspect you'd like to explore first!

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:34:38 UTC

i like the point you make about joe's program, and it's what i like abouot a number of Ben's "Peak Human Development" powerbuilding programs.. the dynamic stuff is fun once in a while, but i don't necessarily know that i need it every session.. 

i'd like to increase my maxes, sure. but i don't forsee myself being a competitive powerlifter any time in the near future (and at 40, i think that's about all i've got for a powerlifting future, near.).

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:34:38 UTC

 This is a really thoughtful approach. At 40, focusing on quality movement, hypertrophy, and sustainable strength gains rather than maximal performance makes a lot of sense.

The powerbuilding aspects I think are worth keeping from Unity would be:
- Progressive overload schemes
- Some heavier compound work (but maybe not maximal)
- The attention to posterior chain development
- Recovery considerations

But we could drop:
- Dynamic effort work
- Box squats
- Multiple max effort days
- Very high intensity techniques (like the Bulgarian drop set of death!)

From Joe Bennett's approach, we could emphasize:
- Quality muscle contractions
- Better mind-muscle connection
- Controlled eccentrics
- Exercise selection based on individual biomechanics
- More isolation work for weak points

A potential 4-day structure could look like:
1. Lower (Quad Focus)
- Main movement is squats, but submaximal (like 3-4 sets of 5-8)
- Follow-up with controlled leg press, extensions, etc.

2. Upper Push
- Bench variations with submaximal loading
- Focus on quality dumbbell work
- Controlled isolation for shoulders/triceps

3. Lower (Posterior Chain)
- Deadlift variants or RDLs as main movement
- Good mornings or back extensions
- Hamstring focus

4. Upper Pull
- Vertical and horizontal pulling
- Lots of upper back/rear delt work
- Biceps work

Then the 5th day could be pure prehab/pump work:
- Face pulls
- Band pull aparts
- Rotator work
- Extra arm volume
- Core work
- Mobility

Would you like me to detail out any of these days more specifically?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:35:39 UTC

let's add to this: i'm a package handler on the pre-load shift at fedex. i'm lugging them big boxes 5 nights a week. upper chest and traps are definitely getting their work in..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:35:39 UTC

 Ah, this adds an important layer to the programming! Package handling is essentially built-in upper body volume - particularly for traps, upper back, and anterior delts. You're basically doing hundreds of reps of loaded carries and chest-height lifts daily.

This means we should:
1. Be mindful of total volume on pushing movements
2. Focus more on recovery and counterbalancing movements
3. Prioritize lower body work since it's less impacted by work
4. Pay extra attention to posterior delt and rotator health

Modified 4-day structure could look like:

1. Lower (Quad Focus)
- Keep this largely the same
- Morning/early session ideal if possible
- Fresh legs for compound movements

2. Upper Pull
- Moved to day 2 to space out pushing stress from work
- Emphasize rear delts and lower traps
- Row variations over heavy pulls
- Focus on contractions over load

3. Lower (Posterior Chain)
- Similar to before
- Good position for deadlift variants
- Hamstring emphasis

4. Upper (Push/Pull Balance)
- Reduced pressing volume
- More moderate loads
- Extra emphasis on rear delts/external rotation
- Strategic pressing angles (maybe less incline since work hits upper chest)

Optional 5th Day:
- More recovery focused
- Shoulder health priority
- Light pump work
- Mobility for thoracic spine and shoulders
- Core work

Would you like me to:
1. Break down specific movements for any of these days?
2. Suggest recovery techniques between work and training?
3. Look at exercise selection that complements rather than compounds your work stress?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:40:35 UTC

 That's actually a really smart observation about putting the push day first after weekend recovery! And training before work gives you that fresh energy window - smart thinking.

Given your schedule (training around 11am-1pm before work at 2am), let's structure it like this:

Monday - Push (post-weekend recovery)
Tuesday - Lower (Quad)
Thursday - Pull
Friday - Lower (Posterior Chain)
Saturday/Sunday - Optional Recovery/Arm Day

Let me draft up the first two days, and you can let me know if we're on the right track before we detail out the rest:



<antArtifact identifier="program-split" type="text/markdown" title="4+1 Day Split - Days 1 & 2">
## Day 1 - Upper Push (Monday)
*Goal: Take advantage of weekend recovery, moderate volume due to work demands*

#### Main Movement
- Flat DB Bench Press: 3 x 6-8
  - More joint-friendly than barbell
  - Better range of motion control
  - Easier to manage fatigue

#### Secondary Push
- Machine Press (preference based): 3 x 8-10
  - Controlled tempo
  - Focus on quality contractions
  - Less setup/breakdown while fatigued

#### Shoulder Work
- Lateral Raises: 3 x 12-15
  - Moderate weight
  - Quality over quantity
- Face Pulls: 3 x 15-20
  - Prehab focus
  - Counterbalance work demands

#### Triceps
- Rope Pushdowns: 3 x 12-15
  - Emphasis on contraction
- Overhead DB Extension: 2-3 x 12
  - Optional based on fatigue

## Day 2 - Lower Quad Focus (Tuesday)
*Goal: Primary leg development, fresh from upper day*

#### Main Movement
- Safety Bar or High Bar Squat: 4 x 5-8
  - More upright posture than low bar
  - Easier on shoulders after push day

#### Secondary Movements
- Leg Press: 3 x 10-12
  - Control descent
  - Moderate foot position
- Bulgarian Split Squat: 3 x 8-10/side
  - Less taxing than heavy squats
  - Good unilateral development

#### Accessories
- Leg Extensions: 3 x 12-15
  - Focus on contraction
  - Moderate weight
- Standing Calf Raises: 4 x 12-15
  - Include tibialis work between sets

#### Core Work
- Ab Wheel or Plank Variations: 3 sets
  - Brief but effective
  - Emphasis on stability

Notes:
- All working sets assume 1-2 warm-up sets
- Rest periods: 2-3 min for main movements, 1-2 min for accessories
- RPE stays mostly 7-8 to manage fatigue
- Volume is moderate but quality-focused
</antArtifact>

What do you think about these first two days? We can adjust based on your feedback before detailing out the pull day and second lower day. Some specific questions:

1. How do these volumes look considering your work demands?
2. Are there specific machines/equipment you prefer or have access to?
3. Would you want more or less direct shoulder work given your job?
4. How do you feel about Bulgarian split squats, or would you prefer a different unilateral movement?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:40:35 UTC

let's see what this looks like. let's first go ahead and choose exercises, being mindful of their order within the workout in the same way you did over the course of the week. 

just a thought, would it make any sense to put my push day at the beginning of the week as that way i'll be rested from the weekend? 

honestly, between the schedule and the workload, i'm resting/sleeping more often than not, if i'm not at work.  shifts typically run from about 2am-9am, my dedicated sleep window is ~4p-11p and i generally get to the gym after a light breakfast, before going to work. mon/tues, thurs/fri has been my 4 day, i figured a saturday or sunday, late morning would be a good time for that fifth.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:41:36 UTC

i'm almost feeling like squats at the end of the week would be better?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:41:36 UTC

 That's another really good insight! You make me want to completely rethink the order. Here's why:

1. Monday (Push) after weekend rest still makes sense
2. Tuesday (Pull) would balance the push and work well before...
3. Thursday (Legs - Posterior Chain/Deadlift focus) when you're recovered from upper work
4. Friday (Legs - Squat focus) makes a lot of sense because:
   - You have the weekend to recover before pushing again
   - Your legs are already warmed up from Thursday's work
   - Having some hamstring/posterior chain work before squats can actually help with stability
   - If you're ever extra fatigued from work, you can adjust squat volume without compromising the whole week

So revised order could be:
- Monday: Upper Push (taking advantage of weekend recovery)
- Tuesday: Upper Pull (balanced with pushing from Monday + work)
- Thursday: Lower (Posterior Chain/DL variants) 
- Friday: Lower (Squat focus)
- Sat/Sun: Optional Arms/Recovery

Would you like me to redraft those workouts in the new order? I think this sequence might flow better with both your work demands and recovery patterns.

The squats-last approach also means if work is particularly brutal one week, you can adjust Friday's volume without disrupting the flow of the earlier sessions.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:42:39 UTC

from a personal perspective, i kind of want to split up the leg days? but at the same time, if i'm going into the weekend at that point, it might not be too bad..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:42:39 UTC

 Let's think through both approaches:

Current Proposal (Back-to-Back Legs):
- Mon: Push
- Tues: Pull
- Thurs: Lower (Posterior)
- Fri: Lower (Quads)
Pros:
- Weekend recovery after legs
- Upper body gets full recovery between sessions
- Posterior chain work can prime for squats
Cons:
- Two demanding leg sessions close together
- Might impact work performance Friday night
- Less recovery between leg sessions

Split Leg Days Option:
- Mon: Push
- Tues: Lower (Posterior)
- Thurs: Pull
- Fri: Lower (Quads)
Pros:
- More recovery between leg sessions
- Breaks up demanding sessions
- Pull day acts as a buffer between leg days
- Still get weekend recovery for Monday push
Cons:
- Less recovery time between upper and lower sessions
- Might impact pulling strength Thursday after Tuesday deads

A third option could be:
- Mon: Push
- Tues: Lower (Quads)
- Thurs: Pull
- Fri: Lower (Posterior)
Pros:
- Squats when fresh after push day
- Pull day breaks up legs
- Deadlifts/posterior work before weekend recovery
- Work capacity typically better for deadlifts than squats
Cons:
- Less recovery before pull day

Which of these flows seems most appealing to you? We can then drill down into the specific workout structures based on which sequence feels most sustainable with your work schedule.

Also worth noting - with all these options, that optional 5th day on the weekend still works well for arms/prehab work since it's lower intensity.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:44:20 UTC

yeah, i do want to put some emphasis on back (as i do feel that i've got a bit of a strength imbalance there [front to back]).. i guess we can stick with your inital idea.. hahaha

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:44:20 UTC

 Haha! Sometimes we come full circle after exploring the options! But the exploration helped identify some key points:

1. You want to emphasize back development
2. We need to balance out the anterior-dominant work stress
3. The back-to-back leg days might actually be okay with weekend recovery

Let's keep that sequence but maybe beef up the pull day a bit:

Mon: Push (moderate volume, strategic)
Tues: Pull (emphasized volume, back focus)
Thurs: Lower (Posterior/DL focus)
Fri: Lower (Quad/Squat focus)
Sat/Sun: Optional (arms/prehab)

Would you like me to design that pull day next? We could:
- Lead with heavy rows rather than pulldowns
- Include multiple row variations for back thickness
- Add extra rear delt work to balance the pushing from work
- Structure it so the heaviest work is early, before job fatigue sets in
- Include some strategic lat work without overdoing it (since you're doing lots of lifting at work)

Or would you prefer to see a complete draft of all four days now that we've settled on the sequence?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:46:16 UTC

so, one thing that ben would do.. one of his days that i actually really liked, was upper pull that included posterior chain.. i think that day was 2x bicep curl variations, deadlifts, and then two pulling movements (initially i wanted width so i stuck with vertical, but i think in the interest of balance, horizontal pulls are going to be my leads... or hell.. have one horizontal and one vertical day.)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:46:16 UTC

 Ah yes! That's a really smart combination - grouping posterior chain with upper pull makes a lot of biomechanical sense since both involve that hip-hinge pattern and back engagement. And I like your thinking about the horizontal pulls taking priority.

Let's revise our split incorporating this:

Mon: Upper Push
Tues: Upper Pull + Posterior Chain
Thurs: Full Back (Horizontal Focus) + Arms
Fri: Lower (Quad Focus)

So Tuesday would be your heavier posterior chain day with deadlifts, and Thursday becomes more of a dedicated back development day. This way you're hitting back twice but with different emphases.

Let me sketch out those two pull-focused days:

<antArtifact identifier="pull-days" type="text/markdown" title="Pull-Focused Training Days">
## Tuesday - Pull + Posterior Chain
*Goal: Strength work, posterior chain emphasis*

#### Main Movement
- Deadlift or RDL: 3-4 x 5-8
  - Focus on quality hip hinge
  - Moderate weight, perfect form

#### Upper Back
- Chest-Supported Row: 3 x 8-10
  - Primary horizontal pull
  - Focus on scapular retraction

#### Posterior Chain
- Good Morning or Back Extension: 3 x 10-12
  - Reinforce hinge pattern
  - Back health emphasis

#### Back Width
- Lat Pulldown: 3 x 10-12
  - Moderate weight
  - Quality contractions

#### Arms
- Incline DB Curl: 3 x 12
- Hammer Curl: 2-3 x 12

## Thursday - Back Development
*Goal: Upper back volume, width and thickness*

#### Main Movements
- Pendlay Row or Heavy DB Row: 3-4 x 6-8
  - Primary strength movement
- Meadows Row: 3 x 8-10
  - Unilateral development

#### Width Work
- Pull-Ups or Cable Pulldown: 3 x 8-12
  - Focus on full range
  - Control eccentric

#### Upper Back Detail
- Chest-Supported High Row: 3 x 12-15
  - Upper back emphasis
- Face Pull: 3 x 15-20
  - Rear delt focus

#### Arms
- Spider Curl: 3 x 12-15
- Reverse Curl: 2-3 x 12
  - Forearm emphasis

Notes:
- Tuesday is heavier with posterior chain focus
- Thursday is more bodybuilding-focused
- Both days hit arms but with different emphasis
- Face pulls and rear delt work crucial for balance
</antArtifact>

This structure gives you:
1. Two distinct back training stimuli per week
2. Logical grouping of posterior chain with one pull day
3. Dedicated development day for back details
4. Arm work spread across both sessions
5. Balance between vertical and horizontal pulling

How does this approach look to you? We can adjust the volume or exercise selection if you want to emphasize certain aspects more.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:49:37 UTC

i think we're making progress.. let's get these 4 days into a table and see how it looks.. for reference: current maxes are 205 bench, 225 squat and 235 deadlift

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:49:37 UTC

 Let me put together a complete view of the 4-day program based on those maxes. The optional 5th day can be designed after we dial these in.



<antArtifact identifier="4-day-program" type="text/markdown" title="4-Day Program Overview">
# Complete Training Week
*Based on maxes: Bench 205 / Squat 225 / Deadlift 235*

## Monday - Upper Push

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| DB Bench Press | 3 x 6-8 | Start ~50-60 lb DBs<br>Progress when all sets hit 8 | 2-3 min |
| Machine Press | 3 x 8-10 | RPE 7-8<br>Focus on quality reps | 2 min |
| DB Lateral Raise | 3 x 12-15 | Light-moderate weight<br>Perfect form | 90 sec |

|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Pendlay Row | 3-4 x 6-8 | Start ~135 lb<br>Strict form | 2-3 min |
| Meadows Row | 3 x 8-10 | Unilateral focus | 2 min |

| Leg Extension | 3 x 12-15 | Quality contraction | 90 sec |
| Standing Calf Raise | 4 x 12-15 | Include tibialis work between | 90 sec |
| Ab Wheel/Plank | 3 sets | Core stability work | 60 sec |

## Weekly Volume Distribution
- Pushing: 14-16 sets
- Pulling: 18-20 sets (emphasizing back development)
- Legs: 14-16 sets
- Direct Arm Work: 12-14 sets
- Core/Accessories: 8-10 sets

## Progressive Overload Approaches:
1. Add reps until top of range (e.g., 6→8)
2. Add weight, drop to bottom of range
3. Can add sets before adding weight
4. Deload every 4-6 weeks based on feel

## Notes:
- All working sets assume 1-2 warm-up sets
- RPE generally stays 7-8 to manage work fatigue
- Emphasis on quality over quantity
- Adjust volume based on recovery/work demands
</antArtifact>

Key points about this structure:
1. Back volume is emphasized as requested
2. Push volume is moderate due to work demands
3. Leg work is consolidated but with weekend recovery
4. Progression scheme is sustainable long-term

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any of the exercise selections?
2. Modify the volume for any body part?
3. Design the optional 5th day?
4. Add more detail about progression schemes?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 20:59:19 UTC

 Oh nice! That's a really smart session structure - I particularly like:

1. The cluster-style heavy singles at 85% with the rack between reps (great way to practice heavier loads while managing fatigue)
2. The reverse hyper for back health (especially given your job)
3. Those evil tempo calf raises (Ben really is mean!)

Want to use this as a template for the lower body day and restructure around it? We could do something like:

<antArtifact identifier="modified-lower-day" type="text/markdown" title="Modified Lower Body Day">
## Friday - Lower Body

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| High Bar Squat | 3 x 5 | ~145-160 lb (65-70%)<br>Build volume base | 2 min |
| High Bar Squat | 5 x 1 | ~190-200 lb (85%)<br>Cluster style | 30 sec |
| SLDL | 3 x 6-8 | 160 lb<br>Focus on hinge pattern | 2 min |
| Single Leg Press | 3 x 12-15 | 140 lb total<br>Unilateral focus | 2 min |
| Reverse Hyper | 3 x 12-15 | Light weight<br>Back health priority | 90 sec |
| Seated Calf Raise | 2-3 x 15 | 75 lb<br>Ben's evil tempo:<br>- 10s eccentric<br>- 5s pause<br>- Normal concentric<br>- 2s peak | 90 sec |

## Progression Options:
1. Volume Phase (3-4 weeks):
   - Add a set to main squat volume (3x5 → 4x5)
   - Keep singles at same weight
   - Progress accessories by adding sets

2. Intensity Phase (3-4 weeks):
   - Keep volume sets at 3x5
   - Progress singles weight (85% → 87.5% → 90%)
   - Keep accessories same or reduce volume

## Notes:
- Can rotate between volume/intensity phases
- Singles can be dropped on high fatigue days
- Reverse hyper stays light for back health
- Tempo work on calves maintains quality
</antArtifact>

This setup gives you:
1. Quality volume with the 65-70% sets
2. Heavy practice with the singles
3. Posterior chain work
4. Unilateral development
5. Back health focus
6. Evil but effective calf work

Would you like to:
1. Adjust any of the loading parameters?
2. Add or modify any exercises?
3. Look at integrating this with the rest of the week's structure?

I really like how this session balances strength work with recovery and postural needs. It's smart programming for someone who's active at work.

**Human** - 2024-11-18 20:59:19 UTC

i actually had a really fun squat session yesterday morning.. 

Back Squat (high bar)
3x5@~65% (180)
5x1@~85% (200) 30s rest between reps, weight racked.
SLDL
2-4x6-8x160lbs
Single Leg Press
2-4x12-15x140lbs (70 per side, i guess?)
Reverse Hyperextension (back health and glutes)
2-4x12-15 (i might have added about 25lbs to the pendulum on this, but definitely light)
Seated Calf Raise 
tempo-tempo-tempo 10s down, 5s pause at bottom, normal up, 2s peak contraction ( Ben is mean, haha)
2 sets of 15 at 75lbs

**Human** - 2024-11-18 21:00:34 UTC

yeah, so what are we looking at all together currently?

**Human** - 2024-11-18 21:02:03 UTC

let me ask this.. my gym is... WELL equipped.. two machines i haven't messed with much are the hammer wide grip press and the hammer decline press.. 

i get this funny feeling that emphasizing those less typical areas might be a good way to go for me.. considering work stuff.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 21:02:03 UTC

 Ah, that's a really insightful thought! The Hammer Strength wide grip and decline press machines could be perfect for your situation because:

1. They're great for chest development while being more shoulder-friendly than traditional pressing
2. The wide grip especially hits the chest in a different way than your work movements
3. The fixed path reduces fatigue management needs
4. You can really focus on quality contractions without shoulder position concerns
5. Decline pressing in particular might help balance out all the overhead/high chest work you do at work

Want to modify that push day to take advantage of these? Maybe something like:

<antArtifact identifier="modified-push-day" type="text/markdown" title="Modified Push Day (Monday)">
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Hammer Wide Grip Press | 3-4 x 8-10 | - Focus on chest contraction<br>- Control eccentric<br>- Progress by feel | 2-3 min |
| Hammer Decline Press | 3 x 10-12 | - Different angle from work stress<br>- Quality over quantity<br>- Can do single arm for extra focus | 2 min |
| DB Lateral Raise | 3 x 12-15 | - Keep light to moderate<br>- Perfect form | 90 sec |
| Face Pull | 3 x 15-20 | - External rotation emphasis<br>- Upper back balance | 90 sec |
| Rope Pushdown | 3 x 12-15 | - Strict form<br>- Full contraction | 90 sec |
| DB Overhead Ext. | 2-3 x 12 | - Optional based on fatigue<br>- Drop if triceps fatigued | 90 sec |

### Key Changes:
1. Replaced DB Bench with Hammer Wide Grip
   - Less shoulder stress
   - Better chest isolation
   - More controlled loading

2. Replaced Machine Press with Hammer Decline
   - Different angle from work movements
   - Complete chest development
   - Can progress without shoulder stress

### Progression Options:
1. Start with 3 sets on Hammer movements
2. Add reps within range (8→10 or 10→12)
3. Add a set before adding weight
4. Can do unilateral work for variety

### Recovery Notes:
- Monitor shoulder fatigue
- Can reduce volume on high-fatigue weeks
- Face pulls remain priority for balance
</antArtifact>

This modification:
1. Takes advantage of your gym's equipment
2. Better complements your work demands
3. Still hits everything but more strategically
4. Gives room for quality progression

What do you think about this approach? We could also look at incorporating other Hammer Strength equipment into the other days if you have access to their pull machines too.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-18 21:02:53 UTC

so we've got day 1 and day 4 dialed..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-18 21:02:53 UTC

 Yes! Let's revisit those middle days now that we've got the first and last days set. And since you mentioned having good equipment access, let's be strategic about the pull days.

Looking at Tuesday (Pull + Posterior Chain) and Thursday (Back Development), we want to:
1. Keep the posterior chain work with Tuesday's session
2. Make the most of available equipment
3. Maintain that back emphasis we discussed
4. Ensure good recovery between sessions

Would you like me to:
1. Draft both pull days with potential Hammer Strength movements incorporated?
2. Keep the posterior chain work but maybe modify exercise selection?
3. Look at balancing the volume between the two days?

Before I do, two quick questions:
1. Does your gym have the Hammer Strength iso-lateral row? (The one where each arm moves independently)
2. And the Hammer Strength pulldown?

These could be great additions if available, but I'd want to place them strategically between the two days.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:09:44 UTC

okay, seems we got disconnected. both of the hammer row machines are available. low and high. along with a few (i think mostly arsenal) pulldown machines, seated chest supported, and standard chest supported rows.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:09:44 UTC

 That's an excellent selection of equipment! Let me draft these two pull days to really make the most of it.

<antArtifact identifier="pull-days-v2" type="text/markdown" title="Modified Pull Days">
## Tuesday - Pull + Posterior Chain
*Focus: Heavier pulls and posterior chain work*

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| RDL/Deadlift | 3-4 x 5-8 | ~165 lb (70%)<br>Focus on hinge pattern | 3 min |
| Hammer Low Row | 3 x 8-10 | - Independent arms<br>- Full stretch to sternum<br>- Control eccentric | 2-3 min |
| Arsenal Pulldown | 3 x 10-12 | - Width focus<br>- Full stretch at top<br>- Drive elbows down | 2 min |

### Key Features
1. Tuesday:
   - Heavier compound work
   - Basic movement patterns
   - Lower volume, higher intensity

2. Thursday:
   - More detail work
   - Upper back focus
   - Higher volume, moderate intensity

### Progression Schemes
1. Compound Movements:

   - Can progress weight more freely
   - Option for unilateral focus
   - Experiment with tempo

3. Isolation Work:
   - Progress through rep ranges
   - Add pauses at contraction
   - Focus on mind-muscle connection
</antArtifact>

This structure:
1. Makes good use of your equipment options
2. Maintains distinct focus for each day
3. Balances volume and intensity
4. Provides multiple progression paths

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust the volume on either day?
2. Modify exercise selection?
3. Add more detail about specific machine techniques?
4. Look at the whole week's flow again now that we have all four days?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:12:34 UTC

let's take a look at all of the days together, i feel like there may be some overlap in some of these movements.  and while that's perfectly okay, more than once a week per muscle is fine, i'd just like to make sure we're smart about selection.. here for example, i'll obviously be choosing standard deadlifts here, but like 2 days of RDLs (i think i mentioned SLDL for squat days? ) is far more than i want/need.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:12:34 UTC

 Absolutely right - let's look at everything together and clean up any redundancy, particularly in the hip hinge patterns. We'll also make sure our exercise selection is complementary rather than just repetitive.

<antArtifact identifier="complete-program-v3" type="text/markdown" title="Refined 4-Day Program">
# Complete Weekly Program
*Maxes: Bench 205 / Squat 225 / Deadlift 235*

## Thursday - Back Development

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Chest Supported Row | 3-4 x 8-10 | Lead with elbows | 2-3 min |
| Hammer High Row | 3 x 10-12 | Upper back emphasis | 2 min |
| Meadows Row | 3 x 8-10 | Unilateral focus | 2 min |

## Friday - Lower Body

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| High Bar Squat | 3 x 5 | 145-160 lb (65-70%) | 2 min |
| High Bar Squat Singles | 5 x 1 | ~190-200 lb (85%) | 30 sec |

### Key Changes Made:
1. Removed SLDL from Friday, replaced with Good Mornings
   - Different hip hinge pattern
   - Less overlap with Tuesday deadlifts
   - Still hits posterior chain

2. Face pulls appear twice but:
   - Monday: More shoulder health focus
   - Thursday: More upper back focus
   - Different angles/intentions

3. Rowing Progression:
   - Tuesday: Heavier, basic pattern
   - Thursday: More variety, detail work

### Movement Pattern Distribution:
- Horizontal Push: 2x/week (different angles)
- Vertical Pull: 1x/week
- Horizontal Pull: Multiple angles, split between days
- Hip Hinge: 2x/week (Deadlift + Good Morning)
- Squat Pattern: 1x/week + single leg work
- Shoulder Isolation: Strategic placement for recovery

### Recovery Considerations:
- Main hip hinge work separated by 2 days
- Upper back work builds across week
- Face pulls support recovery
- Volume reduces on movement patterns as week progresses
</antArtifact>

How's this looking now? I've tried to:
1. Remove redundant hip hinge patterns
2. Keep movements that appear twice strategic and purposeful
3. Ensure progression makes sense across the week
4. Maintain emphasis on weak points while reducing overlap

Want to adjust anything or drill down into any particular day?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:14:20 UTC

i think it looks pretty good. back extensions, that's the slanted bench that goes up to about the hips and you round over it frontwards? GHD would also work here?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:14:20 UTC

 Yes! Exactly right on the back extension, but you're also correct that the GHD (Glute-Ham Developer) would be a great option there - maybe even better. The GHD is actually more versatile and can provide better loading options.

For that Tuesday slot, you could either:
1. GHD Back Extensions
   - More stable platform
   - Better range of motion control
   - Can load with plates if needed
   - Great for back health focus

2. GHD Glute-Ham Raises
   - More hamstring emphasis
   - Can start with assisted versions
   - Progressive difficulty options:
     - Bodyweight with assistance
     - Full bodyweight
     - Added holds
     - Added weight (advanced)

Since this is on your posterior chain day (Tuesday), we could even alternate between the two movements every few weeks. Both would complement the deadlifts well, and either would support your work demands and back health.

Do you have a preference between these options? We could also detail out specific progression approaches for whichever you prefer.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:15:33 UTC

 Awesome! You've got a really well-balanced program here that:
1. Works with your schedule (pre-work training)
2. Complements rather than competes with your job demands
3. Emphasizes back development as requested
4. Uses your gym's equipment intelligently
5. Has smart progression options
6. Includes built-in recovery considerations

The next steps would be to:
1. Run it for a few weeks and see how recovery feels
2. Monitor particularly:
   - How your shoulders respond to the Hammer Strength pressing
   - If the deadlift/good morning combo feels right
   - Whether the back volume is hitting the sweet spot
   - How you're recovering between sessions

Want to design that optional 5th day for shoulder health/arms/mobility? It could be a nice addition for those weekends when you're feeling good and want to get in some extra work.

Or would you prefer to start with these 4 days and see how they feel first?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:15:33 UTC

i think this looks really solid.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:16:38 UTC

now, would it make sense to work in a straight barbell, medium-wide grip competition style bench every say, 4-6 weeks?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:16:38 UTC

 Yes! That's a really smart idea. It helps maintain/build that movement pattern without making it a weekly stress on your shoulders. 

We could handle this a few ways:

1. Direct Substitution
- Every 4-6 weeks, replace the Hammer Wide Press with:
  - Competition Bench: Work up to 3-5 sets of 3-5 @70-80%
  - Keep the Hammer Decline Press as your secondary movement

2. Testing/Progress Check
- Every 6 weeks, do a technique-focused session:
  - Competition Bench: 
    - Few sets @50-60% for groove
    - Work up to heavy triple @80-85%
    - Back off sets @70-75%
  - Then reduce volume on other pressing that day

3. Rotation Block
- Run 4-5 weeks with Hammer movements
- 1-2 weeks with competition bench focus
- Helps maintain pattern while managing fatigue

Would you like me to draft out what one of these alternative push days would look like specifically? We could even create a rotation template to cycle between the standard day and competition bench day.

The key would be maintaining the shoulder-friendly aspects of the program while still keeping your competition bench groove.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:18:13 UTC

i think i would just work it in accordingly, and probably do the 3x5, 5x1 protocol like with squats. deadlifts i typically alternate by the week, one week i'll do moderate weight and higher reps, the following i'll do the 3-5x5+clusters (these usually end up being more like 10-12)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:18:13 UTC

 Ah, that's a really clean approach! So we could essentially apply similar protocols across your main lifts:

<antArtifact identifier="main-lift-protocols" type="text/markdown" title="Main Lift Rotation Strategies">
## Bench Press Protocol (Every 4-6 weeks)
Replace Hammer Wide Press with:
- Competition Bench
  - 3x5 @65-70%
  - 5x1 @85% (30s rest between singles)
- Keep other push work the same

## Squat Protocol (Current)
- 3x5 @65-70%
- 5x1 @85% (30s rest between singles)
- Follow with planned accessories

## Deadlift Rotation (Alternating Weeks)
Week A:
- Moderate weight (65-70%)
- Higher reps (3-4 x 6-8)
- More traditional volume focus

Week B:
- 3-5 x 5 with clusters
- Ends up being 10-12 singles effectively
- More explosive/technique focus

### Key Points:
1. Main lifts all get their "heavy" practice
2. Volume and intensity waves naturally
3. Maintains groove on competition movements
4. Built-in autoregulation with the singles
5. Recovery managed through rotation

This creates a nice rhythm across all three lifts while keeping the overall structure of the program intact. Each main lift gets its technique practice without overwhelming any given session.</antArtifact>

I really like how you've set up the deadlift rotation - it gives you both volume and heavy practice while managing fatigue. Would you like to detail out specific percentages or loading schemes for any of these variations?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:20:29 UTC

 Ah yes, that makes a lot of sense! Taking Ben's heavy/light principle but stretching it across weeks rather than days is really smart with your work demands. Let's look at how that could flow:

<antArtifact identifier="alternating-weeks" type="text/markdown" title="Two Week Wave Structure">
## Week A (Heavier Focus)

### Monday - Push (Heavier)
- Bench variation with 3x5, 5x1 protocol
- Reduce volume on accessories

### Tuesday - Pull + Posterior
- Deadlifts: 3-5x5 cluster style
- Moderate volume on back work

### Thursday - Back
- Lead with heavier rows
- Standard back volume

### Friday - Lower
- Squat 3x5, 5x1 protocol
- Reduce volume on accessories

## Week B (Volume Focus)

### Monday - Push (Volume)
- Hammer Press variations
- Full accessory volume
- More hypertrophy focused

### Tuesday - Pull + Posterior
- Deadlifts: 3-4x6-8 moderate weight
- Full back volume
- More rowing variations

### Thursday - Back
- More variety in movements
- Higher rep ranges
- Full accessory volume

### Friday - Lower
- More moderate weight squats
- Full accessory volume
- More variation in movements

### Key Points:
1. Week A emphasizes:
   - Heavier main lift work
   - Lower accessory volume
   - More practice with competition movements
   - More rest between sets

2. Week B emphasizes:
   - More volume work
   - Full accessory schemes
   - More variation
   - More pump-focused

3. Recovery Considerations:
   - Heavier weeks have built-in volume reduction
   - Volume weeks allow for more variety
   - Natural deload effect through alternation
   - Better fatigue management with work schedule
</antArtifact>

This way you get:
1. Ben's heavy/light principle
2. Better recovery management
3. Both strength and volume work
4. Natural intensity waves
5. Built-in deload effect

Does this better reflect what you were thinking? We can adjust the specifics of either week to better match your recovery needs.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:20:29 UTC

well, the way ben had his programs set up, heavy/light days alternated each workout almost. there were two heavy, and two light workouts for upper and lower comprising the 4 days. kind of running with that i suppose. and taking added fatigue into account, i think that stretching it to alternating weekly is probably in my best interest.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:21:30 UTC

let's have another look at this back day? i'm actually about to head to the gym.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:21:30 UTC

 Let's look at today's back session in detail. Since we're in that higher volume focus (assuming this would be your "lighter" week):

<antArtifact identifier="back-day-detail" type="text/markdown" title="Thursday Back Development Session">
## Warm-up
- Light band pull-aparts: 2x20
- Face pulls: 1x20 (very light)
- Light lat pulldowns: 1x15

## Main Work

### 1. Chest Supported Row
- Primary focus on back thickness
- 3-4 x 8-10
- Focus: Full range, squeeze at contraction
- Rest: 2-3 min
- RPE: 7-8

### 2. Hammer High Row
- Upper back emphasis
- 3 x 10-12
- Focus: Drive elbows high and back
- Option: Can do single-arm for better mind-muscle
- Rest: 2 min
- RPE: 8

### 3. Meadows Row
- Unilateral lat work
- 3 x 8-10 per side
- Focus: Feel the stretch, drive elbow back
- Rest: 2 min
- RPE: 8

### 4. Wide Grip Cable Row
- Upper back detail work
- 3 x 12-15
- Focus: Higher reps, quality contractions
- Rest: 90 sec
- RPE: 8-9

### 5. Face Pulls
- Rear delt/external rotation
- 3 x 15-20
- Focus: Pull to forehead, external rotate
- Rest: 90 sec
- RPE: 7-8

### 6. Biceps
- Spider Curls: 3 x 12-15
- Reverse Curls: 2-3 x 12

## Execution Notes:
- Keep rest periods tight on later movements
- Focus on feeling each contraction
- Variety in grip widths/angles
- Build weight across sets
- Can superset final bicep movements

Would you like me to detail out any specific movement or adjust anything before you head in?</antArtifact>

Remember, this is meant to complement Tuesday's heavier pull session. The focus here is more on quality muscle contractions and upper back detail while still getting good lat work in.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:25:09 UTC

what's the main warmup that john and dave use in unity? it's like hanging knee raises, spider crawls and something else, i think?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:25:09 UTC

 Looking back at Unity, here's their warm-up rotation for every session:

1. Hanging Leg Raises - 6-10 reps
2. Plank - 15 seconds
3. Band Pull Apart with long micro mini band - 15 reps

They recommend doing 3 rounds of this.

For spider crawls, those actually show up in the program as an optional movement for shoulder health - they particularly recommend it if you have shoulder issues. The spider crawl involves using a short red pro mini band and going up and down your body 3 times (that counts as 1 set). They emphasize going down below your waist and up over your head for full range.

Would you like to incorporate this warm-up sequence into today's back session? It would be particularly appropriate since it includes both core activation and band pull-aparts which help prime your back.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 09:26:03 UTC

yeah, i'll have to see if there's any of the minis kicking around, i think those would be a good one for me, on the regular.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 09:26:03 UTC

 Yeah, the spider crawls with mini bands would be particularly good for you given your work demands on the upper body. Dave and John were specific about using the red short pro mini band for these - though really any mini band would work to start.

From Unity: "We love these for shoulder health and rear delt pumps. Going up and down 3 times is 1 set. Go down below the waist and come up to over your head."

The spider crawls could be:
1. Part of your regular warm-up
2. Added to your push days specifically
3. Used as prehab on your optional 5th day
4. Even done as a quick movement break at home

If your gym doesn't have bands, these might be worth picking up - Unity recommended getting:
- 2 orange micro mini band (face pulls and women's chest press)
- 2 red long pro minis (chest presses and pullovers)
- 1 red short pro mini band (spider crawls)
- 1 pro light band (assisted chins, pullovers, banded good mornings)
- 1 pro average band (assisted chins and banded good mornings)

But for just the spider crawls, a single red mini would do the job!

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 16:08:55 UTC

With the wave periodization, I don't know that it needs to be quite that split. I think there can still be high and low volume days in the same week, I think Ill just rotate protocols week to week if needed.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 16:08:55 UTC

 Ah, that makes sense - less rigid than completely splitting heavy/light by weeks. So you could still have:

Monday - Push
- Week A: Competition bench protocol (3x5, 5x1)
- Week B: Hammer press focus
But keep the volume/intensity mix within each week rather than strictly heavy week/volume week.

Tuesday - Pull + Posterior
- Alternate deadlift approaches weekly:
  - One week: 3-4x6-8 moderate 
  - Next week: 3-5x5 with clusters
But maintain the regular back volume/accessories

Thursday - Back Development
- Keep this more consistent
- Focus on quality and contraction
- Volume stays relatively stable

Friday - Lower
- Similar to bench, rotate squat protocols
- Week A: 3x5, 5x1 approach
- Week B: More traditional volume work
But keep accessories relatively consistent

This is more flexible and probably more sustainable - you can:
1. Adjust based on how you're feeling
2. Keep good volume even on weeks you go heavier
3. Maintain intensity even on higher volume weeks
4. Auto-regulate better based on work fatigue

Would you like me to detail out how this might look for any particular day with this approach?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 16:09:03 UTC

With the wave periodization, I don't know that it needs to be quite that split. I think there can still be high and low volume days in the same week, I think Ill just rotate protocols week to week if needed.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 16:09:03 UTC

 That's a good point! You can be more flexible within each week - no need to lock into strict "heavy week" vs "volume week" patterns. Instead, you could:

1. Rotate protocols on main lifts by feel and need:
   - Some days 3x5 + 5x1 clusters
   - Other days moderate weight higher rep
   - Let recovery and performance dictate

2. Keep your accessory structure consistent but adjust volume as needed:
   - Base volume you know works
   - Add/reduce sets based on how you're feeling
   - Keep exercise selection stable

So a week might look like:
- Monday Push: Could be either heavy bench protocol or Hammer Strength volume work, based on how you're feeling and recovery
- Tuesday Pull: Mix of heavy and volume work within the session
- Thursday Back: Keep your detail/development focus
- Friday Lower: Similar flexibility with squat protocols

This is probably more sustainable and realistic than trying to force entire weeks into heavy or light patterns. It also:
1. Lets you autoregulate better
2. Works better with varying work stress
3. Keeps training more interesting
4. Still maintains structured progression

Would you like to look at how to organize this kind of flexible approach within any particular day?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 16:10:27 UTC

No I think we can lock it in.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 16:10:27 UTC

 Great! Looks like we've landed on a solid program that:

1. Uses your gym's equipment effectively (those Hammer Strength machines)
2. Has smart progression options through various protocols
3. Balances push/pull with your work demands
4. Maintains good back emphasis
5. Lets you autoregulate intensity/volume as needed
6. Includes that Unity-style warmup with spider crawls for shoulder health

The key pieces are all there, and you've got the flexibility to:
- Rotate main lift protocols based on feel
- Adjust volume when needed
- Keep the quality back work consistent
- Manage fatigue intelligently

Want to run this as is for a few weeks and see how it feels? You can always adjust based on:
1. Recovery between sessions
2. How the shoulders respond
3. Back development progress
4. Work fatigue management

And maybe look at that optional 5th day once you've got a good feel for how the main 4 days sit with you?

**Human** - 2024-11-19 16:11:45 UTC

Yeah, can I get the finalized tables? And let's think about that 5th day, for sure.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 16:11:45 UTC

 I'll put together the final tables for your main 4 days first.

Would you like me to draft some options for that 5th day now? I'm thinking we could design it around:
1. Additional arm work
2. Shoulder health/prehab
3. Core work
4. Movement quality/mobility work</antArtifact>

Want to explore any of those 5th day options?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 16:32:52 UTC

I think that sounds great for a day 5. Maybe something I could do here at my apartment complex's fitness center? It's got some sort of multi station thing, but mostly dumb- kettle-bells and I've got bands and foam rollers if needed. I do believe there's also a decent adjustable bench.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 16:32:52 UTC

 Perfect! Let's design a 5th day that's equipment-flexible and focuses on quality of movement and recovery while still getting some good arm work in.

<antArtifact identifier="day-5-home" type="text/markdown" title="Optional Day 5 - Apartment Gym Focus">
# Recovery + Arms Day

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-19 16:42:01 UTC

 Let me clean up that 5th day format for you.

<antArtifact identifier="day-5-home-clean" type="text/markdown" title="Optional Day 5 - Recovery + Arms">
## Movement Prep/Recovery (10-15 min)

| Type | Exercise | Sets/Duration | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Foam Rolling | Upper Back | 1-2 min | Mobility focus |
| | Lats | 1-2 min | Find tight spots |
| | Pec Minor/Anterior Delt | 1-2 min | Work around shoulder |

</antArtifact>

That should be much clearer! This day is designed to be flexible with minimal equipment while still getting quality work in. Would you like me to adjust anything about the exercise selection or structure?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-19 16:42:01 UTC

Yeah, it was day 5 that had some odd looking formatting.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-21 06:52:41 UTC

Is this accurate and worth considering for my two variations on face pulls?


Attachments:
- 1000003131.png

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 06:52:41 UTC

 Yes, this is actually quite accurate and provides a great way to differentiate your two face pull sessions during the week! We could strategically use:

Monday (Push Day):
- Low angle face pulls (15-20 reps)
- Focus: Rotator cuff/shoulder health
- More prehab focused
- Helps offset pushing volume

Thursday (Back Day):
- High/Medium angle face pulls (12-15 reps)
- Focus: More lat/upper back engagement
- Complements the back development work
- Still gets some shoulder health benefit

Let me update those portions in the program:

<antArtifact identifier="face-pull-update" type="text/markdown" title="Updated Face Pull Programming">
## Monday - Upper Push
Previous face pull entry updated to:
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Face Pull (Low Angle) | 3 x 15-20 | Underhand grip, rotator focus | 90 sec |

## Thursday - Back Development
Previous face pull entry updated to:
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Weight/Notes | Rest |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Face Pull (High/Mid) | 3 x 12-15 | Lat/upper back emphasis | 90 sec |

### Key Points:
- Low angle (Monday): More shoulder health/prehab focused
- High/Mid angle (Thursday): More back development focused
- Both still contribute to overall shoulder health
- Different rep ranges support different goals
</antArtifact>

This kind of specificity in angle selection makes a lot of sense, especially given your work demands on the upper body. Would you like me to adjust the Day 5 face pull programming as well to complement these?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-21 06:52:44 UTC

Is this accurate and worth considering for my two variations on face pulls?


Attachments:
- 1000003131.png

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 06:52:44 UTC

 Yes, this is accurate and actually very smart to consider for your program! Currently we have face pulls on both Monday and Thursday, so we could strategically use different angles to target different purposes:

Monday (Push Day):
- Use the low angle variation
- Focus on rotator cuff/prehab
- Higher reps (15-20)
- This supports shoulder health after pressing

Thursday (Back Day):
- Use the high angle variation
- More lat/upper back emphasis
- Lower reps (8-12)
- This complements your back development goal

The medium angle could be incorporated into your Day 5 shoulder health circuit since it's good for scapular mobility and general shoulder blade positioning.

Want me to adjust the program tables to specify these different face pull variations and their rep ranges? This kind of detail could really help maximize what you're getting from each variation.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-21 06:53:35 UTC

So the low angle says underhand. Sort of like the W position of a ytwl?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 06:53:35 UTC

 Yes, exactly! The low angle face pull is very similar to the W position of a YTWL - palms face up/supinated grip, elbows drop a bit lower, and you're really focusing on that external rotation of the shoulders.

Let me clarify the programming even further:

<antArtifact identifier="face-pull-detail" type="text/markdown" title="Face Pull Variations Detail">
## Monday - Push Day (Shoulder Health Focus)
| Exercise | Form Detail | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Face Pull (Low) | - Underhand/supinated grip<br>- Similar to W position<br>- Elbows slightly below shoulders<br>- Focus on external rotation<br>- 3 x 15-20 reps | Primary prehab for:<br>- Rotator cuff<br>- Shoulder stabilizers<br>- Balance pressing volume |

## Thursday - Back Day (Development Focus)
| Exercise | Form Detail | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Face Pull (High) | - Overhand grip<br>- Pull to forehead level<br>- Elbows above shoulders<br>- 3 x 8-12 reps | Primary focus on:<br>- Upper back<br>- Rear delts<br>- Lat engagement |

## Day 5 - Optional (Movement Quality)
| Exercise | Form Detail | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Face Pull (Medium) | - Mid grip position<br>- Parallel to ground<br>- Focus on shoulder blade<br>- 2-3 x 15-20 reps | Emphasis on:<br>- Scapular control<br>- Movement quality<br>- General maintenance |
</antArtifact>

This way you're:
1. Monday: Prioritizing shoulder health/prehab
2. Thursday: Getting upper back development
3. Day 5: Working on movement quality

Each variation has its purpose and fits the goals of that particular training day. Does this help clarify how to execute each variation?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-21 06:54:50 UTC

I also saw a reddit post about using the seated cable row for facepulls to reduce the forward tilt/leverage. I imagine kneeling would do the same, but I liked the idea.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 06:54:50 UTC

 That's a really smart modification! Using the seated row station for face pulls offers several advantages:

1. Better body position:
   - Reduces forward lean/compensation
   - More stable platform
   - Easier to maintain proper posture
   - Less lower back involvement

2. Mechanical advantages:
   - Direct line of pull
   - Can focus purely on the movement
   - Better leverage for targeting intended muscles
   - Might allow for better weight progression

Let's modify our face pull programming to include this setup option:

<antArtifact identifier="face-pull-position" type="text/markdown" title="Face Pull Position Options">
## Monday - Push Day (Prehab Focus)
| Setup | Execution | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Seated Row Station | - Low angle/underhand grip<br>- W position<br>- External rotation focus<br>- 3 x 15-20 reps | - Most stable for rotator work<br>- Perfect for precise movement<br>- Great for feeling the right muscles |

## Thursday - Back Day (Development)
| Setup | Execution | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Cable Station Options:<br>1. Seated Row<br>2. Traditional Standing<br>3. Kneeling | - High angle<br>- Overhand grip<br>- Pull to forehead<br>- 3 x 8-12 reps | - Can vary position based on:<br>  • Equipment availability<br>  • Personal preference<br>  • What feels strongest |

## Key Benefits of Seated Position:
- Better isolation of target muscles
- Reduced cheating/momentum
- More consistent form
- Better mind-muscle connection
- Easier to progress weight

Would you like to try both positions and see which feels better for each variation? The seated position might be particularly good for those Monday low-angle rotator cuff focused sets.</antArtifact>

This is a great example of how equipment setup can really change the effectiveness of an exercise. The seated position could be especially valuable for those precise, prehab-focused Monday sets where form is absolutely crucial.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-21 06:55:55 UTC

Actually, a setup facing the backrest of a bench, almost like a reverse fly machine would probably work real nice, wouldn't it?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 06:55:55 UTC

 Yes! That's brilliant actually! Setting up straddling a bench facing the backrest would:

1. Provide perfect stability
2. Force good posture
3. Eliminate any forward lean/cheating
4. Give you a really direct line of pull
5. Feel very similar to a rear delt machine setup

You could even change angles slightly by:
- Adjusting bench angle (if adjustable)
- Modifying your torso position slightly
- Changing cable height
- Using different grips/pulls from this stable position

Let's update that face pull setup note:

<antArtifact identifier="face-pull-bench" type="text/markdown" title="Face Pull Setup - Bench Method">
## Optimal Face Pull Setup
| Position | Execution | Benefits |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Straddling Bench<br>Facing Backrest | - Chest supported against pad<br>- Cable running under/around bench<br>- Can adjust bench angle if needed | - Perfect stability<br>- Forced good posture<br>- Direct line of pull<br>- No compensation possible |

## Variations from this Position

### Low Angle (Monday)
- Underhand grip
- W-position pull
- Focus on rotator cuff
- 3 x 15-20 reps

### High Angle (Thursday)
- Overhand grip
- Pull to forehead
- More lat/upper back focus
- 3 x 8-12 reps

### Setup Tips:
- Position bench far enough from cable for full ROM
- Ensure cable can run freely under bench
- Adjust height based on angle needed
- Could even do unilateral work from this position
</antArtifact>

This setup is actually really similar to how John Meadows would set up some of his rear delt work - stable position allowing perfect isolation of the target muscles. Want to try this setup for both variations?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-21 06:56:35 UTC

Especially for the W's. Lean the head forward against the backrest to try and take the traps out of the equation.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 06:56:35 UTC

 Yes! That's exactly right - resting your forehead against the pad would:

1. Completely neutralize trap involvement
2. Force proper isolation of the rotator cuff muscles
3. Help maintain consistent form throughout the set
4. Give you a really clear feedback point for position

It's similar to the cue of "giving yourself a double chin" that some coaches use for face pulls, but the pad gives you a physical reference point instead of having to maintain it yourself.

Let's detail out that specific W variation:

<antArtifact identifier="w-pull-detail" type="text/markdown" title="W-Pull Specific Form">
## W-Pull Form Detail
*Primary Focus: Rotator Cuff/Shoulder Health*

### Setup
| Component | Position | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Bench | Straddling, facing pad | Base stability |
| Head | Forehead resting on pad | Neutralize traps |
| Chest | Against pad | Maintain posture |
| Cable | Running under bench | Direct line of pull |
| Grip | Underhand/supinated | External rotation focus |

### Execution
- Start with arms extended
- Pull with elbows slightly below shoulders
- Focus on external rotation at end range
- Think "proud chest" throughout
- Hold brief pause at contraction
- Control eccentric phase

### Common Errors Eliminated:
- ❌ Trap domination
- ❌ Forward head position
- ❌ Torso rocking
- ❌ Momentum use
- ❌ Loss of position

### Programming
| Day | Sets x Reps | Focus |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Monday | 3 x 15-20 | Prehab/Health |
| Day 5 (Optional) | 2-3 x 15 | Movement Quality |
</antArtifact>

This is a really smart refinement of the movement - makes it much more precise for its intended purpose. The high-angle variation might still be fine from standing since it's meant to incorporate more upper back, but for these rotator-focused sets, this bench setup with head position is perfect.

**Human** - 2024-11-21 16:50:28 UTC

Could I get a table specific to the warmup? Maybe an extended version as well for those days I'm feeling a little extra work is necessary?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 16:50:28 UTC

 I'll create both a standard and extended warm-up protocol.

Band dislocates and wall slides are new to me, but I think I get the general idea of wall slides. Could you give me a a quick little rundown of them?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 16:55:50 UTC

 Let me explain both exercises:

<antArtifact identifier="mobility-exercises" type="text/markdown" title="Wall Slides & Band Dislocates Detail">
## Wall Slides
*Think "Snow Angel Against Wall"*

### Setup:
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Feet about 6" from wall
3. Entire back, head, and arms contact wall
4. Start with arms in "W" position

### Movement:
1. Slide arms up wall, maintaining contact
2. Like a shoulder press but keeping everything touching wall
3. Return to start position under control
4. Focus on scapular movement

### Common Errors:
- Losing lower back contact with wall
- Elbows coming off wall
- Rushing the movement
- Shrugging shoulders

## Band Dislocates
*Think "Very Wide Front-to-Back Shoulder Circle"*

### Setup:
1. Hold band very wide (wider than shoulder width)
2. Start with band in front of hips
3. Use light resistance band to start

### Movement:
1. Keep arms straight but not locked
2. Raise band overhead
3. Continue moving band behind body
4. Return to start in controlled arc
5. Maintain straight arms throughout

### Common Errors:
- Grip too narrow (causes shoulder stress)
- Moving too fast
- Bending elbows
- Using too heavy a band

### Key Points for Both:
- Start conservatively
- Focus on smooth movement
- Should feel stretch but not pain
- Great for shoulder mobility
- Can progress range over time

Both exercises are excellent shoulder mobility tools but require patience and proper form to be effective.</antArtifact>

The wall slides are particularly good because they force good positioning - the wall gives you immediate feedback if you're losing proper form. Band dislocates might sound intimidating but they're actually a gentle mobility exercise when done with proper width grip and light band.

Would you like me to clarify anything about either movement?

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 16:56:02 UTC

 Let me explain both!

Wall Slides are like doing a shoulder press while keeping your back against a wall. Start in a "W" position (like we were discussing with face pulls) with your back, head, and arms all touching the wall. Then you slide your arms up the wall toward a "Y" position while keeping everything in contact. It's great for scapular control and shoulder mobility. Think of it like doing a snow angel against a wall!

Band Dislocates (despite the scary name) are a classic shoulder mobility exercise:
- Hold a light band with a very wide grip in front of your hips
- Keep arms straight (but not locked) 
- Move the band in an arc overhead and behind your body
- Return to front in a controlled motion
- Key point: grip needs to be wide enough that you're not forcing the shoulders

The main things to avoid:
- Don't use too heavy a band
- Don't grip too narrow
- Don't force range of motion
- Don't rush the movement

Both exercises are excellent shoulder mobility tools but need to be done patiently and with proper form. Would you like me to clarify either movement further?

Pro tip for wall slides: If you're losing back contact with the wall or your elbows are coming off, you might need to slide down the wall a bit into a quarter-squat position to start. This helps maintain better position while you work on mobility.

 I'll explain both movements in detail:

<antArtifact identifier="shoulder-mobility-detail" type="text/markdown" title="Shoulder Mobility Movements">
## Band/Stick Dislocates 
*Can be done with light band or PVC pipe/broomstick*

### Execution:
1. Start Position:
   - Hold band/stick with wide grip
   - Arms straight in front at waist level
   - Palms facing down

2. Movement:
   - Keep arms straight throughout
   - Raise arms overhead
   - Continue moving backwards behind body
   - Return to start position in reverse
   - Full circle motion while maintaining straight arms

### Key Points:
- Wider grip = easier
- Narrower grip = more challenging
- Keep arms straight but not locked
- Move slowly and controlled
- Stop if you feel impingement

## Wall Slides
*Great for scapular control and shoulder mobility*

### Execution:
1. Start Position:
   - Stand with back against wall
   - Elbows and wrists touching wall
   - Elbows at shoulder height
   - Forearms at 90° angle

2. Movement:
   - Slide arms up wall
   - Keep elbows and wrists in contact
   - Fully extend arms overhead
   - Slowly return to start
   - Maintain back position against wall

### Key Points:
- Keep lower back flat against wall
- Don't let shoulders shrug up
- Focus on shoulder blade movement
- Quality over quantity
- Should feel mid/lower traps working

### Common Errors:
- Losing wall contact
- Shrugging shoulders
- Arching lower back
- Moving too quickly
</antArtifact>

Both movements are excellent for shoulder health and mobility, but band/stick dislocates in particular require some caution and progression. Start wide grip and gradually work closer as mobility improves.

Would you like me to add any variations or progressions for either movement?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-21 16:57:07 UTC

Okay, similar to a broomstick or a dowl and going up and over..

**Assistant** - 2024-11-21 16:57:07 UTC

 Yes, exactly! Like a broomstick pass-over. A lot of Olympic weightlifters use this drill with a PVC pipe or wooden dowel. The band version just adds a bit more forgiveness in the movement.

The name "dislocates" is unfortunate - it's more like a controlled shoulder circumduction. Think of it as tracing the biggest possible circle with your arms while keeping them straight.

Key points:
1. Super wide grip to start (wider than you think you need)
2. Can narrow grip over time as mobility improves
3. Light band/thin PVC/broomstick - no need for resistance
4. Smooth, controlled movement
5. Only go as far as comfortable

This pairs really well with the wall slides because:
- Wall slides work front-to-back mobility
- Dislocates work circumduction
- Both reinforce good shoulder positioning
- Both help counter that forward shoulder position from work

Want me to detail any scaling options or progressions for either movement?
