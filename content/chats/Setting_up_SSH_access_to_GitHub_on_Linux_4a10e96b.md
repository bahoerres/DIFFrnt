cheatsheet time! i need to setup a new linux installation with ssh access to my github account. what info will you need from me to start?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-31 21:11:46 UTC

 Let me help you set up SSH access to GitHub on your Linux system. To get started, I'll need to know:

1. Have you already:
   - Generated any SSH keys on this system?
   - Created a GitHub account?

That's really all I need to know to start! From there, I can guide you through:
- Generating a new SSH key pair (if needed)
- Adding the key to your SSH agent
- Adding the public key to your GitHub account
- Testing the connection

Let me know about those two points and we can begin!

on this system, i am unsure. github is setup and i have keys for other devices. 

bahoerres@gmail.com is email and bahoerres as the username

 Thanks! Let's check if you have any existing SSH keys first, then proceed with either using those or creating new ones.

1. First, let's check for existing SSH keys:
```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

If you see files like `id_ed25519` or `id_rsa`, you already have keys. If the directory doesn't exist or is empty, we'll create new ones.

2. If you need new keys, let's create them (I recommend using Ed25519 as it's more secure and compact):
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "bahoerres@gmail.com"
```
Just press Enter when asked for the location (to use the default), and choose whether you want a passphrase.

3. Start the SSH agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

4. Add your key to the SSH agent:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

5. Copy your public key (you'll add this to GitHub):
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Would you like me to continue with the GitHub steps, or should we first check what keys you currently have on your system?

no keys, just known hosts.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-31 21:13:08 UTC

 Perfect, let's set up fresh keys for your GitHub access.

1. Create a new Ed25519 key pair:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "bahoerres@gmail.com"
```
(Press Enter for default location, and decide if you want a passphrase - recommended for security)

2. Start the SSH agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your new key to the SSH agent:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

4. Copy your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

5. Now go to GitHub:
   - Visit https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Give it a title (like "Linux Desktop")
   - Paste your public key from step 4
   - Click "Add SSH key"

6. Test the connection:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
You should see a message like "Hi bahoerres! You've successfully authenticated..."

Want me to walk you through any of these steps in more detail?

fish: Unsupported use of '='. In fish, please use 'set SSH_AUTH_SOCK /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXa0APbI/agent.372339'.

in the step with eval

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-31 21:13:50 UTC

 Ah, you're using the fish shell! Let me adjust those commands for fish:

1. Your Ed25519 key should have been created fine with:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "bahoerres@gmail.com"
```

2. For fish shell, start the SSH agent with:
```fish
eval (ssh-agent -c)
```

3. Then add your key:
```fish
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

4. Copy your public key:
```fish
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

The rest of the steps (adding to GitHub and testing) remain the same. Try these fish-compatible commands and let me know if you run into any other issues!

from here i just copy and paste the key into github with a new id right?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-31 21:14:43 UTC

 Yes, exactly! Just:

1. Copy the entire output from the `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` command
2. Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Click "New SSH key"
4. Give it a descriptive title (like "Linux Desktop" or whatever helps you remember which machine this is)
5. Paste the key into the "Key" field
6. Click "Add SSH key"

After that, you can test it with:
```fish
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You might get a warning about authenticity of github.com the first time - that's normal, just type 'yes' to continue.
