 # Learning Network Security Through Homelab Projects

## Introduction: The Accidental Hacker

Picture this: It's 2 AM, and you've just finished setting up your first home server. You're feeling pretty proud of yourself, ready to call it a night, when suddenly your partner shouts from the living room, "Hey, why is our smart TV showing a weird message about bitcoin?" In that moment, you realize you've accidentally exposed your entire home network to the internet. Oops.

This scenario might sound far-fetched, but it's more common than you'd think. As homelab enthusiasts, we're constantly pushing the boundaries of our technical knowledge, but sometimes we forget that with great power comes great responsibility – especially when it comes to network security.

That's why learning network security through homelab projects isn't just a good idea – it's essential. In this article, we'll explore how you can turn your homelab into a cybersecurity playground, learning valuable skills while keeping your digital fortress secure.

## The Foundations: Building Your Secure Homelab

### Step 1: Network Segmentation - The Digital Moat

Think of your homelab network like a medieval castle. You wouldn't want everyone who enters the courtyard to have access to the royal treasury, right? That's where network segmentation comes in.

Start by creating separate VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) for different purposes:

1. Management VLAN: For your core infrastructure devices
2. IoT VLAN: For smart home devices
3. Guest VLAN: For visitors
4. Lab VLAN: For your experimental projects

Here's a basic example of how to set up a VLAN on a Cisco switch:

```
Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name MANAGEMENT
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
Switch(config)# interface range fastethernet 0/1 - 5
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

This creates VLAN 10, names it "MANAGEMENT", and assigns ports 1-5 to this VLAN.

### Step 2: Firewall Configuration - Your Digital Bouncer

Now that you've segmented your network, it's time to control the traffic between these segments. This is where a good firewall comes in. For homelabs, I recommend starting with pfSense or OPNsense – both are powerful, open-source firewall solutions that can run on repurposed hardware.

Key firewall rules to implement:

1. Block all incoming traffic by default
2. Allow specific services only from trusted IPs
3. Implement strict rules between VLANs

Here's a basic pfSense rule to allow SSH access only from your management VLAN:

```
Interface: WAN
Action: Pass
Protocol: TCP
Source: Management VLAN Net
Destination: WAN Address
Destination port range: 22
```

### Step 3: Intrusion Detection/Prevention - Your Digital Guard Dog

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) acts like a vigilant guard dog, constantly sniffing out suspicious activity. Suricata is an excellent open-source option that integrates well with most firewall solutions.

To get started with Suricata on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata
sudo suricata-update
```

Then, edit the configuration file to monitor your network interfaces:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

## Advanced Projects: Leveling Up Your Security Game

### Project 1: Building a Honeypot

A honeypot is like leaving a fake wallet on the ground to catch a pickpocket. It's a decoy system designed to attract and detect potential attackers. Setting up a honeypot can teach you a lot about attack patterns and techniques.

Try setting up T-Pot, a multi-honeypot platform:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce
cd tpotce/iso/installer/
sudo ./install.sh --type=user
```

### Project 2: Log Analysis with ELK Stack

Logs are the unsung heroes of network security. Learning to aggregate and analyze them effectively is crucial. The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is a powerful tool for this purpose.

To install the ELK Stack on Ubuntu:

```bash
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch logstash kibana
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I've locked myself out of my own network!"

Solution: Always maintain an out-of-band management connection. This could be as simple as a Raspberry Pi connected directly to your core switch and router, accessible via a separate WiFi network.

### Challenge 2: "My security measures are slowing down my network."

Solution: Security and performance often involve trade-offs. Focus on optimizing your most critical rules, and consider upgrading your hardware if necessary. Remember, a slightly slower network is better than a compromised one!

## The Big Picture: Why This Matters

Learning network security through homelab projects is like learning to drive in a simulator before hitting the real roads. It provides a safe environment to make mistakes, learn from them, and develop skills that are increasingly crucial in our connected world.

Think of it this way: in the digital age, data is the new oil. Just as oil companies invest heavily in securing their pipelines and refineries, we need to invest time and effort in securing our digital assets. Your homelab is the perfect testing ground for developing these skills.

## Conclusion: Your Homelab, Your Fortress

As we've explored, turning your homelab into a cybersecurity playground is not just educational – it's essential in today's digital landscape. From network segmentation to honeypots, each project builds upon the last, creating layers of security that would make any medieval castle engineer proud.

Remember, the goal isn't to create an impenetrable fortress (which is impossible), but to develop a deep understanding of network security principles and best practices. Each challenge you overcome in your homelab is a lesson learned, preparing you for real-world scenarios.

So, the next time you're up at 2 AM tinkering with your homelab, you can rest easy knowing that your smart TV won't be sending out any unexpected bitcoin messages. Instead, you'll be well on your way to becoming a homegrown cybersecurity expert. Happy labbing, and stay secure!

for the purpose of this, (referencing my network) could we use opnsense as the firewall and a tp-link smart managed switch as the - well - switch?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-27 16:14:14 UTC

 Absolutely! We can certainly tailor the article to use OPNsense as the firewall and a TP-Link smart managed switch for network segmentation. This setup is quite common in home labs and provides a great balance of functionality and affordability. Let me adjust some parts of the article to reflect this change:

In the "Foundations: Building Your Secure Homelab" section, we'll modify Step 1 and Step 2 as follows:

### Step 1: Network Segmentation - The Digital Moat

[...previous content...]

Here's a basic example of how to set up a VLAN on a TP-Link smart managed switch (assuming a web interface, which is common for TP-Link switches):

1. Log into your TP-Link switch's web interface
2. Navigate to the VLAN section (often under "L2 Features" or "VLAN")
3. Create a new VLAN:
   - VLAN ID: 10
   - VLAN Name: MANAGEMENT
4. Assign ports to the VLAN:
   - Select ports 1-5
   - Set them as "Tagged" or "Untagged" depending on your needs

While the exact steps might vary slightly depending on your specific TP-Link model, this general process should work for most TP-Link smart managed switches.

### Step 2: Firewall Configuration - Your Digital Bouncer

Now that you've segmented your network, it's time to control the traffic between these segments. This is where OPNsense comes in – a powerful, open-source firewall solution that's perfect for homelabs.

Key firewall rules to implement in OPNsense:

1. Block all incoming traffic by default
2. Allow specific services only from trusted IPs
3. Implement strict rules between VLANs

Here's how to create a basic OPNsense rule to allow SSH access only from your management VLAN:

1. Log into your OPNsense web interface
2. Navigate to Firewall > Rules
3. Select the appropriate interface (e.g., WAN)
4. Click "Add" to create a new rule
5. Configure the rule as follows:
   - Action: Pass
   - Interface: WAN
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source: Select your Management VLAN network
   - Destination: WAN address
   - Destination port range: 22
6. Save and apply the rule

Remember to place this rule above any default deny rules for it to take effect.

[...continue with the rest of the article...]

By using OPNsense and a TP-Link smart managed switch, you're creating a robust, flexible foundation for your homelab security projects. OPNsense provides powerful firewall capabilities along with many additional features like VPN support and intrusion detection, while the TP-Link switch allows for easy VLAN configuration and network segmentation. This combination gives you a great platform to learn and experiment with network security concepts.

# Ethical Hacking in Your Homelab: Setting Up a Vulnerable Lab Environment

## Introduction: The Curious Case of the Benign Breach

Picture this: It's a quiet Sunday afternoon, and you're lounging on your couch, idly scrolling through tech forums. Suddenly, a post catches your eye - someone's smart home has been compromised, their IoT devices turned into a botnet. As you read through the details, a thought strikes you: "Could this happen to me? How would I even know if it did?"

This moment of realization is often the spark that ignites a journey into ethical hacking. As homelab enthusiasts, we're naturally curious about how things work - and that includes how they can be broken. But testing security on production systems is a big no-no. So, what's a curious tech enthusiast to do?

Enter the vulnerable lab environment - your personal playground for ethical hacking. In this article, we'll explore how to set up a safe, controlled space within your homelab where you can practice offensive security techniques without risking your main network or breaking any laws.

## The Foundations: Building Your Hacking Playground

### Step 1: Isolation - The Quarantine Zone

The first rule of setting up a vulnerable lab is isolation. You want to create a environment that's completely separate from your main network - think of it as a quarantine zone for potentially malicious activities.

Start by creating a dedicated VLAN for your vulnerable lab:

1. Log into your TP-Link smart managed switch
2. Navigate to the VLAN settings
3. Create a new VLAN:
   - VLAN ID: 666 (or any unused ID)
   - VLAN Name: VULNLAB
4. Assign specific ports to this VLAN, ensuring they're not connected to your main network

Next, configure OPNsense to handle this VLAN:

1. Log into OPNsense
2. Go to Interfaces > Assignments
3. Add a new interface for VLAN 666
4. Configure the interface with no internet access and strict firewall rules

### Step 2: Vulnerable Virtual Machines - Your Target Practice

Now that we have our isolated network, it's time to populate it with intentionally vulnerable systems. Here are some popular options:

1. Metasploitable 2: A purposely vulnerable Ubuntu-based VM
2. DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application): A PHP/MySQL web application with various vulnerabilities
3. OWASP Juice Shop: A modern, vulnerable web application

Let's set up Metasploitable 2:

```bash
# Download Metasploitable 2
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip

# Unzip the file
unzip metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip

# Import into your hypervisor (e.g., VirtualBox, Proxmox, etc.)
# Ensure it's connected only to your VULNLAB network
```

### Step 3: Attack Machine - Your Hacking Headquarters

Every ethical hacker needs a base of operations. Kali Linux is a popular choice, packed with a plethora of security tools. Here's how to set it up:

1. Download the Kali Linux image from the official website
2. Create a new VM in your hypervisor
3. Install Kali Linux, ensuring it's connected only to your VULNLAB network
4. Update and upgrade your Kali system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Advanced Projects: Leveling Up Your Hacking Skills

### Project 1: Web Application Penetration Testing

Use DVWA to practice common web vulnerabilities:

1. Set up DVWA in your vulnerable lab
2. From your Kali machine, use tools like Burp Suite and sqlmap to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities
3. Practice cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
4. Attempt to escalate privileges within the application

### Project 2: Network Penetration Testing

Use Metasploitable 2 to practice network-level attacks:

1. Conduct a network scan using Nmap:

```bash
nmap -sV -O <Metasploitable_IP>
```

2. Identify vulnerable services
3. Use Metasploit Framework to exploit these services:

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS <Metasploitable_IP>
exploit
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I'm worried about malware escaping my lab environment."

Solution: Strict network isolation is key. Use a separate physical network if possible, or at minimum, a strictly controlled VLAN. Never connect your vulnerable lab to the internet or your main network.

### Challenge 2: "I'm not sure if I'm learning real-world applicable skills."

Solution: While vulnerable VMs are great for learning, they often have unrealistic or outdated vulnerabilities. Supplement your learning with CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions and bug bounty programs on platforms like HackerOne for more current, real-world experience.

## The Big Picture: Why This Matters

Setting up a vulnerable lab environment is like creating a flight simulator for cybersecurity. It provides a safe space to make mistakes, learn attack techniques, and understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited - all without the risk of causing real damage or legal issues.

Think of it this way: In the world of cybersecurity, knowledge of offensive techniques is crucial for building strong defenses. By understanding how attacks work, you're better equipped to prevent them in real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion: Hack to Protect

As we've explored, setting up a vulnerable lab environment in your homelab is an invaluable step in your cybersecurity journey. From isolated networks with OPNsense and TP-Link switches to purposely vulnerable VMs, each component of your lab contributes to a comprehensive learning experience.

Remember, the goal here isn't to become a black hat hacker, but to understand vulnerabilities so you can better defend against them. Each exploit you learn to execute is a vulnerability you learn to patch.

So, the next time you read about a smart home being compromised, you'll not only understand how it happened, but you'll know exactly how to prevent it. Welcome to the world of ethical hacking - where we break things to make them stronger!

# Building a SOC in Your Homelab: Implementing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

## Introduction: The Night the Logs Came Alive

It was 3 AM when your phone buzzed with an urgent alert. Bleary-eyed, you checked the message: "Unusual login activity detected on home server." Your heart raced as you sprang out of bed and rushed to your computer. As you sifted through logs from various devices, you realized something: managing security for even a small home network is a complex task. If only you had a central system to collect, analyze, and alert on all this data...

This scenario is a common wake-up call (literally and figuratively) for many homelab enthusiasts. It's the moment when you realize that having cool tech isn't enough - you need to be able to monitor and secure it effectively. This is where a Security Operations Center (SOC) with a robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system comes into play.

In this article, we'll explore how to build your own miniature SOC right in your homelab, centered around a SIEM solution. We'll turn that 3 AM panic into a calm, informed response to security events.

## The Foundations: Building Your Homelab SOC

### Step 1: Choosing Your SIEM - The Brain of Your Operation

For our homelab SOC, we'll use the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) as our SIEM solution. It's open-source, powerful, and flexible enough for both small and large-scale deployments.

Let's start by setting up the ELK Stack:

```bash
# Update your system
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Java
sudo apt-get install default-jre -y

# Install Elasticsearch
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch -y

# Install Logstash
sudo apt-get install logstash -y

# Install Kibana
sudo apt-get install kibana -y

# Start and enable the services
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start logstash
sudo systemctl enable logstash
sudo systemctl start kibana
sudo systemctl enable kibana
```

### Step 2: Log Collection - Gathering Intelligence

Now that our SIEM is set up, we need to feed it data. We'll use Filebeat to collect logs from various sources and ship them to Logstash.

Install Filebeat on each system you want to monitor:

```bash
sudo apt-get install filebeat -y
```

Configure Filebeat to collect system logs:

```yaml
# /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  paths:
    - /var/log/*.log
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<your-logstash-server>:5044"]
```

### Step 3: Log Processing - Making Sense of the Data

Configure Logstash to receive logs from Filebeat and process them before sending to Elasticsearch:

```ruby
# /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-beats-input.conf
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

# /etc/logstash/conf.d/30-elasticsearch-output.conf
output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
    manage_template => false
    index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{[@metadata][version]}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Projects: Leveling Up Your SOC

### Project 1: Creating Custom Dashboards in Kibana

1. Log into Kibana (usually at http://localhost:5601)
2. Go to "Visualize" and create new visualizations for:
   - Failed SSH attempts over time
   - Top 10 IP addresses accessing your systems
   - System resource usage trends
3. Combine these visualizations into a dashboard for a quick overview of your network's security status

### Project 2: Setting Up Alerts

Use Kibana's alerting feature to notify you of potential security events:

1. In Kibana, go to "Stack Management" > "Rules and Connectors"
2. Create a new rule for detecting multiple failed login attempts
3. Set up an action to send an email or Slack message when the rule triggers

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I'm drowning in logs! How do I find what's important?"

Solution: Start with basic log filtering and gradually refine your queries. Focus on critical systems and known indicators of compromise. Use Kibana's machine learning features to detect anomalies automatically.

### Challenge 2: "My ELK stack is consuming too many resources."

Solution: Optimize your Elasticsearch cluster, implement log rotation and archiving strategies, and consider upgrading your hardware or moving to a dedicated machine for your SIEM.

## The Big Picture: Why This Matters

Building a SOC in your homelab is like setting up a miniature NASA mission control for your network. It provides visibility, context, and alerting capabilities that transform raw log data into actionable security intelligence.

Think of it this way: In the digital world, logs are like security camera footage. Having cameras is good, but you need someone (or something) watching those feeds 24/7 to really benefit from them. Your SIEM is that tireless watcher, alerting you only when something requires your attention.

## Conclusion: From Reactive to Proactive

As we've explored, setting up a SOC with SIEM capabilities in your homelab is a game-changer for your security posture. From centralized log collection with Filebeat to powerful analysis and visualization with the ELK Stack, you've built a system that transforms the way you approach network security.

Remember, the goal isn't just to respond faster to incidents (although that's a great benefit). It's about moving from a reactive to a proactive security stance. With your homelab SOC, you're not just waiting for alerts - you're actively hunting for threats, understanding your network's behavior, and continuously improving your defenses.

So, the next time something goes bump in the network night, you won't be frantically searching through disparate logs. Instead, you'll calmly open your Kibana dashboard, assess the situation with full context, and respond with confidence. Welcome to the world of proactive homelab security!

# Threat Hunting in Your Homelab: Advanced Techniques for Proactive Security

## Introduction: The Ghost in the Machine

It was a quiet Tuesday evening when you decided to check your homelab's security dashboards, more out of habit than expectation. As your eyes scanned the logs, something caught your attention - a series of failed login attempts that didn't quite fit the usual pattern. They weren't numerous enough to trigger your automated alerts, but something about them felt... off.

This moment marks your first step into the world of threat hunting. It's the realization that not all threats announce themselves with blaring alarms and flashing lights. Some lurk in the shadows, waiting to be discovered by those curious and skilled enough to find them.

In this article, we'll explore how to take your homelab security to the next level through proactive threat hunting. We'll move beyond passive monitoring and automated alerts, learning to actively search for hidden threats that might be lurking in your network.

## The Foundations: Building Your Threat Hunting Arsenal

### Step 1: Developing a Hypothesis - The Hunter's Intuition

Threat hunting starts with a hypothesis - an educated guess about where threats might be hiding. Let's develop our first hypothesis:

"There may be unauthorized SSH access attempts originating from unexpected geographic locations."

To test this, we'll need to:
1. Collect SSH access logs
2. Correlate IP addresses with geographic locations
3. Identify access attempts from unusual locations

### Step 2: Data Collection - Gathering the Evidence

We'll use Filebeat to collect SSH logs and send them to our ELK stack:

```yaml
# /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  paths:
    - /var/log/auth.log
  tags: ["ssh"]
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
```

### Step 3: Data Analysis - Following the Trail

Now, let's create a Kibana query to analyze our SSH logs:

1. Open Kibana and go to "Discover"
2. Create a new index pattern for your SSH logs
3. Use this query to find SSH access attempts:

```
tags:ssh AND message:("Failed password" OR "Accepted password")
```

4. Add a Geo IP filter to map IP addresses to locations

## Advanced Projects: Leveling Up Your Threat Hunting

### Project 1: Detecting Lateral Movement

Hypothesis: "An attacker may be attempting to move laterally within the network after gaining access to one system."

1. Collect network flow data using Zeek (formerly Bro):

```bash
sudo apt-get install zeek
```

2. Configure Zeek to send logs to your ELK stack
3. In Kibana, create a dashboard to visualize internal network connections, focusing on unusual patterns or volumes of traffic between systems

### Project 2: Identifying Dormant Malware

Hypothesis: "There may be dormant malware on a system, periodically beaconing to a command and control server."

1. Use OSquery to collect detailed system information:

```bash
sudo apt-get install osquery
```

2. Write custom OSquery queries to look for:
   - Unexpected network connections
   - Unusual processes
   - Modifications to system files

3. Send OSquery logs to your ELK stack and create alerting rules for suspicious findings

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I'm not sure what to look for. How do I know what's truly suspicious?"

Solution: Start by understanding your network's baseline behavior. Use your SIEM to establish what's "normal" for your homelab. Anything that deviates significantly from this baseline is worth investigating.

### Challenge 2: "Threat hunting seems time-consuming. How can I make it more efficient?"

Solution: Automate repetitive tasks and data collection. Use tools like Ansible to deploy and update your hunting scripts across multiple systems. Regularly refine your hunting hypotheses based on your findings.

## The Big Picture: Why This Matters

Threat hunting in your homelab is like being a detective in your own digital domain. It's not just about waiting for alarms to go off; it's about actively looking for clues that something might be amiss.

Think of it this way: Traditional security measures are like locks on your doors. They're essential, but a determined intruder might still find a way in. Threat hunting is like regularly patrolling your property, looking for signs of intrusion that might not be immediately obvious.

## Conclusion: Becoming the Predator, Not the Prey

As we've explored, threat hunting transforms your approach to homelab security from reactive to proactive. You're no longer just defending; you're actively seeking out potential threats before they can cause harm.

Remember, the goal of threat hunting isn't always to find threats (although that's certainly important when they exist). It's about continuously improving your understanding of your network, refining your detection capabilities, and staying one step ahead of potential attackers.

So, the next time you're reviewing your logs on a quiet evening, you won't just be passively monitoring. You'll be actively hunting, armed with hypotheses, data, and the skills to uncover hidden threats. Welcome to the world of proactive threat hunting - where you become the predator, not the prey!
