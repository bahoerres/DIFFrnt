in my previous chat, i've gone ahead and gotten chatvim setup and so far, it seems to be working okay. it did just kick me this error, and i was hoping you might be able to help:

 Based on the error traceback you've shared, it appears you're encountering an "Overloaded" error from Anthropic's API when trying to use ChatVim. This typically indicates that the API service is temporarily experiencing high load and couldn't process your request.

The error path shows:
1. The error originates from the Anthropic API handler
2. It's being caught and re-thrown as an InternalServerError through LiteLLM
3. This is happening during an async chat response in your ChatVim plugin

Here are a few suggestions to handle this:

1. **Retry the request**: Since this is a temporary overload error, simply trying again after a short wait might resolve the issue.

2. **Implement retry logic**: If this happens frequently, you might want to modify your ChatVim plugin to include automatic retry logic. You could add something like:

```python
from time import sleep
from functools import wraps
import litellm

def retry_on_overload(max_retries=3, delay=1):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for attempt in range(max_retries):
                try:
                    return await func(*args, **kwargs)
                except litellm.InternalServerError as e:
                    if "Overloaded" in str(e) and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                        await asyncio.sleep(delay * (attempt + 1))
                        continue
                    raise
            return await func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

3. **Check API quotas**: If you're making many requests in quick succession, you might want to implement rate limiting in your client code.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these solutions in your ChatVim setup?

interesting that you mention the retry logic.. i hopped over to the API console to see what was going on and: 


```
{
  "client_error": false,
  "code": 529,
  "detail": "Overloaded"
}
```

Suggested Action:
Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 18:51:16 UTC

 Ah yes, HTTP 529 is a custom status code that some services use to indicate they're overloaded and specifically requesting clients implement backoff. Let me help you implement a more sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff for your ChatVim plugin.

Here's a more robust implementation that uses exponential backoff:

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps
import random

def exponential_backoff(attempt, base_delay=1, jitter=0.1):
    """Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter."""
    delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), 32)  # Cap at 32 seconds
    jitter_amount = delay * jitter
    return delay + random.uniform(-jitter_amount, jitter_amount)

def retry_with_backoff(max_retries=5, base_delay=1):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for attempt in range(max_retries):
                try:
                    return await func(*args, **kwargs)
                except litellm.InternalServerError as e:
                    if "Overloaded" not in str(e) or attempt == max_retries - 1:
                        raise
                    
                    delay = exponential_backoff(attempt, base_delay)
                    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
            
            return await func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

You can then apply this to your `make_llm_request` method in chatvim.py:

```python
@retry_with_backoff(max_retries=5, base_delay=1)
async def make_llm_request(self, history, model):
    # Your existing request code here
    response = await litellm.acompletion(...)
    for chunk in response:
        # Your existing streaming code
```

This implementation:
1. Uses exponential backoff starting at 1 second (2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc.)
2. Adds small random jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
3. Caps the maximum delay at 32 seconds
4. Will retry up to 5 times before giving up
5. Only retries on the specific "Overloaded" error

Would you like me to help you integrate this into your specific ChatVim implementation?

 I'll help you integrate the retry logic into your ChatVim plugin. First, can you share your current `chatvim.py` file (or at least the relevant parts)? From the error trace, I can see it's located at `/home/blake/.config/nvim/rplugin/python3/chatvim.py`, but seeing your current implementation would help me provide the most accurate guidance for integrating the retry logic.

Based on the error trace, I can see you have methods like:
- `llm_response`
- `make_llm_request`

But I'd like to see how they're currently implemented to make sure we integrate the retry logic in the most appropriate way.

Could you share that code?

is there a keybind to show dotfiles when using - for oil.nvim?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 18:54:16 UTC

 In oil.nvim, you can toggle the display of hidden files (dotfiles) using `.` (period key). This is the default keybinding to show/hide hidden files, similar to how `ls -a` works in the terminal.

So while browsing with oil.nvim, just press `.` to toggle the visibility of dotfiles and hidden directories.

You can also make hidden files visible by default by adding this to your Neovim config:

```lua
require('oil').setup({
  view_options = {
    show_hidden = true
  }
})
```

for whatever reason, when i'm in the dialogue for oil and press . it drops to the next line and inserts  >

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:08:25 UTC

 That sounds like you might be in insert mode rather than normal mode when trying to use the `.` key, or there might be a keybinding conflict.

To use oil.nvim's file browser functionality:

1. Make sure you're in normal mode (press `<Esc>` if unsure)
2. Then press `.` to toggle hidden files

If pressing `.` is still inserting `>` instead of toggling hidden files, we should check:

1. Your oil.nvim configuration to ensure the keybinding hasn't been changed
2. Any potential keybinding conflicts with other plugins

Could you share your oil.nvim configuration? You can also check the default keybindings in oil by typing `:h oil-actions` in Neovim to see if everything is set up correctly.

Also, you can verify you're actually in oil.nvim's buffer by checking if the path starts with `oil://` at the top of the buffer.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:10:16 UTC

 Looking at the `oil.txt` help file you've shared, I can see that the default keybinding for toggling hidden files is `g.` (not just `.` as I incorrectly stated before). 

So while in Oil's file browser:
1. Make sure you're in normal mode (press `<Esc>` if unsure)
2. Press `g.` to toggle hidden files

Alternatively, you can also:
1. Set Oil to always show hidden files by default in your config:
```lua
require('oil').setup({
  view_options = {
    show_hidden = true
  }
})
```

Or you can create a custom keybinding in your Oil setup if you prefer the simple `.` toggle:
```lua
require('oil').setup({
  keymaps = {
    ["."] = "actions.toggle_hidden",
    -- other keymaps...
  }
})
```

The reason you're seeing `>` when pressing `.` is because you're either in insert mode, or the default `.` behavior (repeat last command) is being triggered instead of Oil's toggle hidden files command.

i added that line, and my lsp (I would imagine) gave me something about forgetting to set local? 

i'll open it back up and modify the actions toggle.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:11:40 UTC

 Ah yes, when configuring plugins in Lua, it's best practice to store the result of `require()` in a local variable. Here's the correct way:

```lua
local oil = require('oil')
oil.setup({
  view_options = {
    show_hidden = true
  }
})
```

Or in a single line if you prefer:
```lua
local oil = require('oil').setup({
  view_options = {
    show_hidden = true
  }
})
```

Both methods will work, but storing the require in a local variable:
1. Is more efficient (Lua doesn't need to look up the global scope)
2. Prevents polluting the global namespace
3. Makes the linter happy
4. Allows you to use other oil functions later if needed using the `oil` variable

This is a common pattern you'll see in most Neovim plugin configurations.

i'm also realizing that i'm missing which-key terribly on this setup.. haha

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:12:41 UTC

 Ah yes, which-key is super helpful! Let's get that set up for you. Here's how to install and configure which-key:

1. First, add it to your package manager. If you're using lazy.nvim:

```lua
{
    "folke/which-key.nvim",
    event = "VeryLazy",
    init = function()
        vim.o.timeout = true
        vim.o.timeoutlen = 300
    end,
    config = function()
        local wk = require("which-key")
        wk.setup({
            -- your config options here
        })

        -- You can add oil-specific keybindings to which-key like this:
        wk.register({
            ["g"] = {
                name = "+goto",
                ["."] = { "Toggle hidden files" },
                ["\\"] = { "Toggle trash" },
                ["?"] = { "Show help" },
                ["s"] = { "Change sort" },
                ["x"] = { "Open external" },
            },
            ["-"] = { "Go to parent directory" },
            ["_"] = { "Open cwd" },
            ["`"] = { "Change directory" },
            ["~"] = { "Change tab directory" },
        }, { 
            buffer = nil  -- nil means apply to all buffers
        })
    end
}
```

This will give you nice key hint overlays for Oil's default keybindings. You can adjust the descriptions and add more keymaps as needed.

Would you like me to show you how to set up additional which-key groups for other parts of your config as well?

return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    oil.setup()
    vim.keymap.set("n", "-", oil.toggle_float, {})
    show_hidden = true
  end,
}


that's the current oil config. that's a pretty simple one, huh?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:16:03 UTC

 Yes, that's quite minimal! Let's enhance it a bit while keeping it clean:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    oil.setup({
      -- Put setup options inside here
      view_options = {
        show_hidden = true,  -- This was outside the setup() call before
      },
      -- Optional: customize the float window
      float = {
        padding = 2,
        max_width = 60,
        max_height = 30,
        border = "rounded",
        win_options = {
          winblend = 0,
        },
      },
      -- Optional: customize keymaps
      keymaps = {
        ["g."] = "actions.toggle_hidden",
        ["<C-s>"] = "actions.select_split",
        ["<C-v>"] = "actions.select_vsplit",
      },
    })
    
    -- Your toggle float keybind
    vim.keymap.set("n", "-", oil.open_float, { desc = "Open oil file browser" })
  end,
}
```

Key changes:
1. Moved `show_hidden` inside the `setup()` configuration where it belongs
2. Added some commonly useful options for the float window
3. Added a description to your keybind (which will show up in which-key)
4. Changed `oil.toggle_float` to `oil.open_float` (toggle_float isn't in the docs, did you mean open_float?)

You can add more features as you need them, like:
- Custom columns (`columns = { "icon", "size", "mtime" }`)
- Delete to trash option (`delete_to_trash = true`)
- Natural sorting (`natural_order = true`)

Would you like me to explain any of these options in more detail?

upon reopening, i get recommended to use this style: 


{
    { "-", desc = "Go to parent directory" },
    { "_", desc = "Open cwd" },
    { "`", desc = "Change directory" },
    { "g", group = "goto" },
    { "g.", desc = "Toggle hidden files" },
    { "g?", desc = "Show help" },
    { "g\\", desc = "Toggle trash" },
    { "gs", desc = "Change sort" },
    { "gx", desc = "Open external" },
    { "~", desc = "Change tab directory" },
  }

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:18:38 UTC

 Ah yes, that's the Oil documentation style for defining keymaps. Let's update your config to use this more structured format:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    oil.setup({
      view_options = {
        show_hidden = true,
      },
      keymaps = {
        ["-"] = { "actions.parent", desc = "Go to parent directory" },
        ["_"] = { "actions.open_cwd", desc = "Open cwd" },
        ["`"] = { "actions.cd", desc = "Change directory" },
        ["~"] = { "actions.cd", desc = "Change tab directory", opts = { scope = "tab" } },
        ["g."] = { "actions.toggle_hidden", desc = "Toggle hidden files" },
        ["g?"] = { "actions.show_help", desc = "Show help" },
        ["g\\"] = { "actions.toggle_trash", desc = "Toggle trash" },
        ["gs"] = { "actions.change_sort", desc = "Change sort" },
        ["gx"] = { "actions.open_external", desc = "Open external" },
        -- Add your float toggle here with proper format
        ["<leader>-"] = { "actions.select_float", desc = "Open float oil" },
      },
      float = {
        padding = 2,
        max_width = 60,
        max_height = 30,
        border = "rounded",
      },
    })
  end,
}
```

This format:
1. Uses the proper `actions.` prefix for built-in actions
2. Includes descriptions for each keybinding
3. Allows for options to be passed to actions (like the `scope = "tab"` for the `~` binding)
4. Will work better with which-key since the descriptions are properly defined

Note that I changed your `-` float toggle to `<leader>-` since `-` is now used for going to parent directory. You can adjust that keybinding to whatever you prefer.

 Let's debug the Oil keybindings. First, could you try printing out the keymaps to make sure they're being registered? Here's a modified version that should help us see what's happening:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    
    -- Setup oil with basic config first
    oil.setup({
      view_options = {
        show_hidden = true,
      },
    })

    -- Let's verify our keymaps are working
    vim.keymap.set("n", "-", oil.open_float, { desc = "Open oil browser" })
    
    -- Print out what keymaps are registered
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
      pattern = "oil",
      callback = function()
        print("Oil buffer created!")
        local buf_keymaps = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_keymap(0, 'n')
        for _, keymap in ipairs(buf_keymaps) do
          print(string.format("Keymap: %s -> %s", keymap.lhs, keymap.rhs or keymap.callback))
        end
      end
    })
  end,
}
```

This will print out the registered keymaps when an Oil buffer is created. Once we see the output, we can better understand what might be going wrong with the keybindings.

Also, what specifically happens when you try to use the keybindings? Do they do nothing, do something unexpected, or give an error?

**Human** - 2024-11-04 19:22:34 UTC

yeah, it doesnt seem to work though.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-04 19:22:47 UTC

leader space doesnt open the float

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:22:47 UTC

 Ah, let's try this. For opening a float with Oil, we want to make sure we're setting up the keymap correctly. Here's a corrected version:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    oil.setup({
      view_options = {
        show_hidden = true,
      },
    })

    -- Set up the float toggle with leader key
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader><space>", function()
      oil.open_float()
    end, { desc = "Open oil browser in float" })
    
    -- For debugging, let's print when this keybind is pressed
    -- You can remove these lines later
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader><space>", function()
      print("Oil float toggle pressed!")
      oil.open_float()
    end, { desc = "Open oil browser in float" })
  end,
}
```

A few things to check:
1. Make sure your `mapleader` is set before plugins load
2. Verify the keymap is registered with `:nmap <leader><space>`
3. Try pressing your leader key followed by space

If you're still having issues, could you:
1. Confirm what you have set as your leader key?
2. Try pressing the leader key and waiting - do you see which-key popup?
3. Let me know if you get any error messages?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-04 19:23:07 UTC

oh. sorry. my leader is space. leader minus doesnt open the oil float

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:23:07 UTC

 Ah! Now I understand. If your leader is space, let's fix this for `<leader>-`:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    oil.setup({
      view_options = {
        show_hidden = true,
      },
    })

    -- Set up the float toggle with space (leader) + minus
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>-", function()
      oil.open_float()
    end, { desc = "Open oil browser in float" })
  end,
}
```

Now you should be able to press `space` (your leader) followed by `-` to open the Oil float window. If you want to verify the keybinding is registered, you can check with:
`:verbose nmap <space>-`

Let me know if that works better for you!

---

**Human** - 2024-11-04 19:24:20 UTC

i'm confused as to how we want to mesh our two configs: 

return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    oil.setup({
      view_options = {
        show_hidden = true,
      },
      keymaps = {
        ["-"] = { "actions.parent", desc = "Go to parent directory" },
        ["_"] = { "actions.open_cwd", desc = "Open cwd" },
        ["`"] = { "actions.cd", desc = "Change directory" },
        ["~"] = { "actions.cd", desc = "Change tab directory", opts = { scope = "tab" } },
        ["g."] = { "actions.toggle_hidden", desc = "Toggle hidden files" },
        ["g?"] = { "actions.show_help", desc = "Show help" },
        ["g\\"] = { "actions.toggle_trash", desc = "Toggle trash" },
        ["gs"] = { "actions.change_sort", desc = "Change sort" },
        ["gx"] = { "actions.open_external", desc = "Open external" },
        -- Add your float toggle here with proper format
        ["<leader>-"] = { "actions.select_float", desc = "Open float oil" },
      },
      float = {
        padding = 2,
        max_width = 60,
        max_height = 30,
        border = "rounded",
      },
    })
  end,
}

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:24:20 UTC

 I see the confusion. We've got a mix of Oil's internal keymaps and the external vim keymap for opening the float. Let's combine them properly:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  config = function()
    local oil = require("oil")
    oil.setup({
      view_options = {
        show_hidden = true,
      },
      -- These are keymaps used WITHIN oil buffers
      keymaps = {
        ["-"] = { "actions.parent", desc = "Go to parent directory" },
        ["_"] = { "actions.open_cwd", desc = "Open cwd" },
        ["`"] = { "actions.cd", desc = "Change directory" },
        ["~"] = { "actions.cd", desc = "Change tab directory", opts = { scope = "tab" } },
        ["g."] = { "actions.toggle_hidden", desc = "Toggle hidden files" },
        ["g?"] = { "actions.show_help", desc = "Show help" },
        ["g\\"] = { "actions.toggle_trash", desc = "Toggle trash" },
        ["gs"] = { "actions.change_sort", desc = "Change sort" },
        ["gx"] = { "actions.open_external", desc = "Open external" },
      },
      float = {
        padding = 2,
        max_width = 60,
        max_height = 30,
        border = "rounded",
      },
    })

    -- This is the global keymap to OPEN oil float from anywhere
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>-", function()
      oil.open_float()
    end, { desc = "Open oil browser in float" })
  end,
}
```

The key difference is:
- The `keymaps` in `oil.setup()` are for commands you use WHILE BROWSING in oil
- The `vim.keymap.set()` outside of setup is for the command to OPEN oil from anywhere

I removed `["<leader>-"] = { "actions.select_float"...` from the oil keymaps because:
1. That was trying to use a leader key inside oil which isn't what we want
2. `actions.select_float` isn't the correct action - we want `oil.open_float()`

Does this explanation help clarify the distinction between the two types of keymaps?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:35:36 UTC

 Ah yes, let's create a clean, robust which-key configuration! Here's a good starting point for `which-key.lua`:

```lua
return {
  "folke/which-key.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  init = function()
    vim.o.timeout = true
    vim.o.timeoutlen = 300
  end,
  opts = {
    plugins = {
      marks = true,     -- shows a list of your marks on ' and `
      registers = true, -- shows your registers on " in NORMAL or <C-r> in INSERT mode
      spelling = {
        enabled = true,   -- enabling this will show WhichKey when pressing z= to select spelling suggestions
        suggestions = 20, -- how many suggestions should be shown in the list?
      },
    },
    window = {
      border = "rounded",      -- none, single, double, shadow, rounded
      position = "bottom",     -- bottom, top
      margin = { 1, 0, 1, 0 }, -- extra window margin [top, right, bottom, left]
      padding = { 1, 2, 1, 2 }, -- extra window padding [top, right, bottom, left]
    },
    layout = {
      height = { min = 4, max = 25 }, -- min and max height of the columns
      width = { min = 20, max = 50 }, -- min and max width of the columns
      spacing = 3, -- spacing between columns
      align = "left", -- align columns left, center or right
    },
  },
  config = function(_, opts)
    local wk = require("which-key")
    wk.setup(opts)

    -- Default mappings
    wk.register({
      ["<leader>"] = {
        f = { name = "+file" },
        b = { name = "+buffer" },
        w = { name = "+window" },
        t = { name = "+toggle" },
        g = { name = "+git" },
      },
    })

    -- Normal mode mappings
    wk.register({
      -- File related
      ["<leader>f"] = {
        f = { name = "Find file" },
        g = { name = "Live grep" },
        r = { name = "Recent files" },
      },
      -- Buffer related
      ["<leader>b"] = {
        d = { name = "Delete buffer" },
        n = { name = "Next buffer" },
        p = { name = "Previous buffer" },
      },
      -- Window related
      ["<leader>w"] = {
        h = { name = "Window left" },
        j = { name = "Window down" },
        k = { name = "Window up" },
        l = { name = "Window right" },
      },
    })
  end
}
```

This gives you:
1. Good default timeout settings
2. Nice visual layout with rounded borders
3. Support for marks and registers
4. Basic leader key groups set up for common operations
5. Structured in a way that's easy to extend

You can then add specific plugin keybindings as needed. Would you like me to show you how to add mappings for specific plugins like Oil, or would you prefer to keep it generic for now?

**Human** - 2024-11-04 19:35:36 UTC

i think i may have gotten some wires crossed here. let's see that which-key config. even better, how about just a nice robust yet generic .lua 

i think we were trying to tie too many of my specifics together and it just got messy.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:36:47 UTC

 Here's a clean, focused Oil configuration:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  lazy = false,  -- We want this loaded immediately
  priority = 999,  -- High priority since it's our file browser
  opts = {
    -- Oil will take over directory buffers (e.g. `vim .` or `:e src/`)
    default_file_explorer = true,
    -- Buffer-local options to use for oil buffers
    buf_options = {
      buflisted = false,
      bufhidden = "hide",
    },
    -- Send deleted files to trash instead of permanently deleting them
    delete_to_trash = true,
    -- Skip the confirmation popup for simple operations
    skip_confirm_for_simple_edits = true,
    -- Change oil's window appearance
    float = {
      padding = 2,
      border = "rounded",
    },
    -- Constrain the cursor to the editable parts of the oil buffer
    constrain_cursor = "editable",
    -- Your requested keymaps
    keymaps = {
      ["-"] = "actions.parent",
      ["."] = "actions.toggle_hidden",
    },
    -- Show hidden files
    view_options = {
      show_hidden = false,  -- This will let you toggle with '.' instead of always showing
    },
  },
  -- Set up any additional keybindings
  config = function(_, opts)
    require("oil").setup(opts)
    -- Open oil with '-' from any buffer
    vim.keymap.set("n", "-", "<CMD>Oil<CR>", { desc = "Open oil" })
  end,
}
```

This configuration:
1. Makes Oil your default file browser
2. Uses `-` both to open Oil and to go up directories
3. Uses `.` to toggle hidden files
4. Has some quality-of-life settings like trash support and skipping confirmations
5. Keeps the interface clean by hiding oil buffers from the buffer list

You can test it out by:
1. Press `-` anywhere to open Oil
2. Navigate with standard movements (j/k)
3. Press `-` to go up a directory
4. Press `.` to toggle hidden files
5. Press `<CR>` (Enter) to select/open a file or directory

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any of these settings!

**Human** - 2024-11-04 19:36:47 UTC

now lets do the same with oil. 

i would like it to be the default file browser, i would like to open it with just "-" navigating up (../) in the tree will also be - and for dotfiles, just . please

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 19:38:54 UTC

 Yes, let's update both configs based on those health check warnings. Let's start with which-key:

```lua
return {
  "folke/which-key.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  init = function()
    vim.o.timeout = true
    vim.o.timeoutlen = 300
  end,
  opts = {
    plugins = {
      marks = true,
      registers = true,
      spelling = {
        enabled = true,
        suggestions = 20,
      },
    },
    -- Update deprecated window to win
    win = {
      border = "rounded",
      position = "bottom",
      margin = { 1, 0, 1, 0 },
      padding = { 1, 2, 1, 2 },
    },
    layout = {
      height = { min = 4, max = 25 },
      width = { min = 20, max = 50 },
      spacing = 3,
      align = "left",
    },
  },
  config = function(_, opts)
    local wk = require("which-key")
    wk.setup(opts)

    -- Updated to new mapping spec format
    wk.register({
      -- Main groups
      { "<leader>f", group = "file" },
      { "<leader>b", group = "buffer" },
      { "<leader>w", group = "window" },
      { "<leader>t", group = "toggle" },
      { "<leader>g", group = "git" },

      -- File operations
      { "<leader>ff", desc = "Find file" },
      { "<leader>fg", desc = "Live grep" },
      { "<leader>fr", desc = "Recent files" },

      -- Buffer operations
      { "<leader>bd", desc = "Delete buffer" },
      { "<leader>bn", desc = "Next buffer" },
      { "<leader>bp", desc = "Previous buffer" },

      -- Window operations
      { "<leader>wh", desc = "Window left" },
      { "<leader>wj", desc = "Window down" },
      { "<leader>wk", desc = "Window up" },
      { "<leader>wl", desc = "Window right" },
    })
  end
}
```

For Oil, the configuration looks good as is, but we could add a few quality-of-life improvements:

```lua
return {
  "stevearc/oil.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 999,
  opts = {
    default_file_explorer = true,
    buf_options = {
      buflisted = false,
      bufhidden = "hide",
    },
    delete_to_trash = true,
    skip_confirm_for_simple_edits = true,
    -- Improve float appearance
    float = {
      padding = 2,
      max_width = 0.9,  -- 90% of screen width
      max_height = 0.9, -- 90% of screen height
      border = "rounded",
      win_options = {
        winblend = 0,   -- Disable transparency
      },
    },
    -- Add icons if you have nvim-web-devicons
    columns = {
      "icon",

      ["."] = { desc = "Toggle hidden files" },
    }, { buffer = nil }) -- nil means register globally
  end,
}
```

Key improvements:
1. Fixed the which-key deprecated `window` option
2. Updated to the new which-key mapping spec format
3. Added which-key descriptions for oil keybindings
4. Added some useful oil features like natural sorting and icons
5. Improved float window sizing
6. Added escape key to close oil

 Let's fix which-key to completely eliminate those warnings. Here's a cleaner version:

```lua
return {
  "folke/which-key.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  init = function()
    vim.o.timeout = true
    vim.o.timeoutlen = 300
  end,
  opts = {
    plugins = {
      marks = true,
      registers = true,
      spelling = {
        enabled = true,
        suggestions = 20,
      },
    },
    win = {
      border = "rounded",
      position = "bottom",
      margin = { 1, 0, 1, 0 },
      padding = { 1, 2, 1, 2 },
    },
    layout = {
      height = { min = 4, max = 25 },
      width = { min = 20, max = 50 },
      spacing = 3,

which-key is still throwing a fit. 

i know it says that most warning can be ignored, but i'd like to not have to look at it

sorry, this may help narrow down what needs to be changed:

 Looking at the health check, it seems we're registering mappings in a way that's causing duplicates and using an older spec format. Let's fix the which-key config:

```lua
return {
  "folke/which-key.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  init = function()
    vim.o.timeout = true
    vim.o.timeoutlen = 300
  end,
  opts = {
    plugins = {
      marks = true,
      registers = true,
      spelling = {
        enabled = true,
        suggestions = 20,
      },
    },
    win = {
      border = "rounded",
      position = "bottom",
      margin = { 1, 0, 1, 0 },
      padding = { 1, 2, 1, 2 },
    },
    layout = {
      height = { min = 4, max = 25 },
      width = { min = 20, max = 50 },
      spacing = 3,
      align = "left",
    },
  },
  config = function(_, opts)
    local wk = require("which-key")
    wk.setup(opts)

    -- Single registration with all mappings
    wk.register({
      ["<leader>"] = {
        f = {
          name = "file",
          f = { name = "Find file" },
          g = { name = "Live grep" },
          r = { name = "Recent files" },
        },
        b = {
          name = "buffer",
          d = { name = "Delete buffer" },
          n = { name = "Next buffer" },
          p = { name = "Previous buffer" },
        },
        w = {
          name = "window",
          h = { name = "Window left" },
          j = { name = "Window down" },
          k = { name = "Window up" },
          l = { name = "Window right" },
        },
        t = { name = "toggle" },
        g = { name = "git" },
      },
      -- Oil specific mappings
      ["-"] = { desc = "Open oil/parent dir" },
      ["."] = { desc = "Toggle hidden files" },
    })
  end
}
```

This revised version:
1. Uses a single `register` call to avoid duplicates
2. Uses the nested structure that which-key prefers
3. Properly sets up groups and their child commands
4. Includes the Oil mappings in the same registration

The key difference is that we're now using a hierarchical structure rather than flat mappings, which should eliminate the warnings about duplicate registrations and old spec format.
