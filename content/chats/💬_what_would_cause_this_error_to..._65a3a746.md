what would cause this error to be thrown after i just installed i2c-dev?

sudo modprobe i2c-dev
modprobe: FATAL: Module i2c-dev not found in directory /lib/modules/6.11.2-arch1-1

 This error suggests that the i2c-dev module is not present in your kernel modules directory for your current kernel version. Here are a few potential reasons and steps to troubleshoot:

1. Kernel version mismatch: The error message shows you're using kernel 6.11.2-arch1-1. Make sure the i2c-dev package you installed is compatible with this kernel version.

2. Incomplete installation: The i2c-dev module might not have been properly installed or built for your current kernel.

3. Missing dependencies: Some required dependencies might be missing.

To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. Update your system:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```

2. Ensure the i2c-tools package is installed:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S i2c-tools
   ```

3. Check if the module is available but not loaded:
   ```
   find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name '*i2c*.ko*'
   ```

4. If the module is found, try to load it manually:
   ```
   sudo modprobe i2c_dev
   ```
   (Note the underscore instead of hyphen)

5. If it's still not working, you might need to rebuild your kernel modules:
   ```
   sudo mkinitcpio -P
   ```

6. After these steps, reboot your system and try loading the module again.

If you're still encountering issues, it would be helpful to know:
- The exact command you used to install i2c-dev
- The output of `uname -a`
- The contents of `/etc/modules-load.d/` if you've created any custom configuration files there

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
