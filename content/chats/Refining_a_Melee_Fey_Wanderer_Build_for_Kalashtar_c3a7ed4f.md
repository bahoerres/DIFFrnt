Without changing any of the progression. Could you clean this up into something a little more presentable as a guide? One thing to note, I intend to level as a kalashtar, not a leonin.

Of course that won\'t always happen, so in that case, on\nRound 1 you\'ll cast Summon Beast as your action and run up into within\n10 feet of as many enemies as possible and Roar, causing fear, and then\nour Beast makes their attack, so it\'s not like we\'re doing 0 damage\nduring round 1 (and there\'s nothing wrong with starting out the fight\nwith a bit of control/debuff). Then, on Round 2, we cast Shillelagh as a\nBA and jump into the fight. After that, we get to use our BA to make\nattacks as well, thanks to our PAM feat. So yes, when I calculate\ndamage, I\'m going to assume that we\'re getting 3 attacks with our\nQuarterstaff, and one attack from our Summoned Beast, even though we\nwon\'t actually see all of that happening in the same round until Round\n3.\n\nDamage Report! Vs. 10 AC: 31 DPR, Vs. 15 AC: 25 DPR\n\nLevel 7\n\n-   Beguiling Twist\n\nLevel 8\n\n-   ASI/Feat: Fey Touched (Wisdom 18)\n\nLevel 9\n\n-   3^rd^ Level Spells: Revivify, Summon Fey, Dispel Magic, Conjure\n    Animals\n\nOk so for our level 9 damage report, we\'ve made some minor improvements\nto our damage. We have a better companion and have seen a small bump to\nour Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus. The biggest power gains we\'ve\nhad actually come from our control/debuff options thanks to beguiling\ntwist and summon fey, but those won\'t show up in the damage numbers,\neven though they\'re awesome.\n\nDamage Report! Vs. 10 AC: 38 DPR, Vs. 16 AC: 27 DPR\n\nLevel 10\n\n-   Deft Explorer: Tireless\n\n-   Nature\'s Veil\n\nLevel 11\n\n-   Dreadful Strikes = 1d6 now\n\n-   Fey Reinforcements\n\nLevel 12 (Druid 1)\n\n-   Druidic\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Spells: Shillelagh, Healing Word\n\nLevel 13 (Ranger 12)\n\n-   Swap to Dueling Fighting Style\n\n-   ASI/Feat: +Wis (20)\n\n-   4^th^ level spell slots now\n\nSo, for our Damage Report here, we\'re still assuming 3 attacks per turn,\nbut now with two Summoned Fey helping out -- one that you cast with your\n4^th^ level spell slot, that gets two attacks, and one that you cast\nwith your free casting (which, according to the Sage Advice Compendium,\nmeans that it only functions at the lowest possible level, or level 3).\nOnce again, I appreciate that this is a "best case scenario" report, as\nthese reports typically are, and that there will be times that you may\nnot think it worth it to spend the time and resources to get two Fey\nsummoned. Assuming you can make it work, however, you\'re looking at 3\nattacks from you with your Shillelagh\'d quarterstaff, adding 5 to each\nattack from your Wisdom score, plus 2 more from Dueling Fighting Style,\nplus 1d6 for Dreadful Strikes, and 3 more attacks from your two Fey, one\nfor 2d6+6 and two for 2d6+7, for a total of 2d8 plus 1d4 plus 7d6 plus\n41.\n\nDamage Report! Vs 10 AC: 76 DPR, Vs. 17 AC: 57 DPR\n\nLevel 14 (Druid 2)\n\n-   We now have two 4^th^ level spell slots\n\n-   Wild Shape\n\n-   Druid Circle: Circle of Spores\n\n-   Halo of Spores\n\n-   Symbiotic Entity\n\nLevel 15 (Druid 3)\n\n-   2^nd^ level spells: Your choice\n\nLevel 16 (Druid 4)\n\n-   ASI/Feat: Resilient: Constitution\n\nLevel 17 (Druid 5)\n\n-   3^rd^ level spells: Pick your favorites\n\n-   6^th^ level spell slot now\n\nOk so, for our final damage report, just to satisfy my curiosity and in\nthe name of exploring what\'s possible, even if infrequent, I\'ll just go\nahead and assume that we\'re in one of those fights where we were setting\nan ambush or had scouted around the corner and saw the enemy waiting for\nus or whatever, so we\'re firing on all cylinders. This means one Fey\ncast at level 6 and one at level 5, Symbiotic entity going, Shillelagh,\netc. Our level 6 Fey would be attacking 3 times per turn for 2d6+9 each\ntime, our level 5 Fey twice for 2d6+8, and then we\'d be hitting 3 times\nfor 1d8 (or 1d4 on our BA) +1d6 from Symbiotic Entity +7 plus a d6 from\nDreadful Strikes for a total of 14d6 + 2d8 + 1d4 + 54.\n\nDamage Report! Vs. 10 AC: 121 DPR, Vs. 18 AC: 91 DPR\n'}

It would be great if you could help me out with a backstory too. My character's name is Kaelen, and while I know that the druid levels come later, if there could be kind of a dark side to the story playing towards the death/decay aspect of the spore druid. One important thing to note is also the "seemingly innocuous" event where I first touched the fey. 

Draw on your knowledge of the game and it's themes and concepts to aide in this request.

**Assistant** - 2024-07-03 23:38:24 UTC

 Certainly! I'd be happy to help craft a backstory for Kaelen that incorporates both the Fey Wanderer and Circle of Spores elements. Here's a potential backstory:

Backstory: Kaelen, the Fey-Touched Wanderer

Kaelen was born into a small Kalashtar community nestled in a dense forest bordering the Feywild. From a young age, he was taught to revere nature and respect the delicate balance between life and death. His people's connection to the dream realm of Dal Quor gave him an innate understanding of the ethereal and otherworldly.

As a child, Kaelen often wandered the woods alone, feeling more at home among the trees than with his own kind. It was during one of these solitary excursions that his life changed forever. He stumbled upon a clearing bathed in an unnatural, shimmering light. In the center stood a beautiful, yet decaying tree. Its branches were adorned with vibrant, otherworldly flowers, while its trunk was riddled with luminescent fungi.

Drawn by curiosity, Kaelen reached out to touch the tree. The moment his fingers grazed its bark, he felt a surge of energy course through him. The world around him shifted, colors became more vivid, and he could hear whispers on the wind. Unknown to him at the time, this seemingly innocuous act had opened a connection to the Feywild, marking him as a Fey Wanderer.

In the years that followed, Kaelen honed his newfound abilities, learning to blend the magic of the Feywild with his innate psychic talents. He became a protector of the forests, a bridge between the material world and the realm of the Fey. His community both revered and feared him, seeing him as blessed but also touched by forces beyond their understanding.

However, as Kaelen delved deeper into the mysteries of nature, he began to perceive a darker undercurrent. The cycle of life and death, growth and decay, fascinated him. He started to notice the beauty in rot, the potential in decomposition. This interest led him to seek out hidden groves where rare fungi grew, studying their properties and the role they played in the ecosystem.

His obsession with this aspect of nature grew, causing concern among his people. Some whispered that his touch with the Fey had corrupted him, while others believed he was simply exploring a necessary, if unsettling, part of the natural order.

Feeling increasingly alienated from his community and driven by an insatiable curiosity about the balance between life and death, Kaelen decided to leave his homeland. He set out to explore the wider world, seeking to understand the intricate dance between growth and decay, between the vibrant magic of the Feywild and the somber reality of mortality.

Now, Kaelen wanders the lands, a guardian of nature's secrets and a student of its darkest mysteries. His path walks a fine line between light and shadow, between the whimsical magic of the Fey and the sobering truths of life's inevitable end. He knows that one day, he must reconcile these seemingly opposing forces within himself, but for now, he embraces both aspects of his nature, ever curious about where this dual path might lead.

This backstory incorporates:
1. The Kalashtar heritage and its connection to the dream realm
2. The "seemingly innocuous" event that connected Kaelen to the Feywild
3. The development of his Fey Wanderer abilities
4. A growing fascination with the cycle of life and death, hinting at his future as a Spore Druid
5. A reason for him to be a wanderer, setting up his adventuring lifestyle

**Human** - 2024-07-04 00:05:09 UTC

uhoh, looks like a small error in the progression. the original goes 1-11 ranger, then a level in druid and back to ranger to finish out at lvl 12

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-04 00:05:09 UTC

 I apologize for the oversight. You're absolutely right. Let me correct that part of the progression. Here's the revised version of the relevant section:

```markdown
### Progression

#### Levels 1-11: Ranger (Fey Wanderer)

[Levels 1-11 remain the same as before]

#### Level 12 (Druid 1)
- Druidic
- Spells: Shillelagh, Healing Word

#### Level 13 (Ranger 12)
- ASI: +2 Wisdom (20)
- 4th Level Spell Slots
- Fighting Style Change: Dueling

#### Levels 14-17: Druid (Circle of Spores)

##### Level 14 (Druid 2)
- Wild Shape
- Circle of Spores: Halo of Spores, Symbiotic Entity

##### Level 15 (Druid 3)
- 2nd Level Druid Spells

##### Level 16 (Druid 4)
- ASI/Feat: Resilient (Constitution)

##### Level 17 (Druid 5)
- 3rd Level Druid Spells
- 6th Level Spell Slot
```

This correction maintains the 11 Ranger/1 Druid/1 Ranger/5 Druid progression as intended in the original build. The rest of the markdown document can remain the same. Thank you for catching that error!
