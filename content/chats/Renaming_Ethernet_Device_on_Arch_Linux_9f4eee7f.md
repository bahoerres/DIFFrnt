i've got an ethernet device that i'd like to rename on archlinux. currently it's enp101s0f4u1u4 (kind of crazy, right?) i'd love it to be something like eth0. 

i know there's a way, but i have no idea where to begin.

 That's a valid request - those auto-generated interface names can indeed get quite unwieldy! Renaming your Ethernet device on Arch Linux is definitely possible. Here's a concise guide to help you rename it to eth0:

1. Create a new udev rule file:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-network.rules
   ```

2. Add this line to the file:
   ```
   SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="<MAC_ADDRESS>", NAME="eth0"
   ```
   Replace <MAC_ADDRESS> with your device's actual MAC address.

3. Find your device's MAC address:
   ```
   ip link show enp101s0f4u1u4
   ```

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

5. Reboot your system for the changes to take effect:
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

After rebooting, your interface should be renamed to eth0.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?

let's get it to work, first.  then we can talk about it.  

i created the file, the output of ‚ùØ ip link show enp101s0f4u1u4 is:
2: enp101s0f4u1u4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 80:3f:5d:fb:45:5f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

and i modified your line in step to to be :
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="80:3F:5D:FB:45:5F", NAME="eth0"

 Great, you've made good progress. Let's continue with the process:

1. The MAC address you've used looks correct. Make sure the file content is exactly as you've written:

   ```
   SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="80:3F:5D:FB:45:5F", NAME="eth0"
   ```

2. Save the file if you haven't already.

3. To apply the changes without rebooting, you can try the following steps:

   a. Reload the udev rules:
      ```
      sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
      ```

   b. Trigger udev to apply the new rule:
      ```
      sudo udevadm trigger --attr-match=subsystem=net
      ```

4. Check if the interface name has changed:
   ```
   ip link show
   ```

   Look for eth0 in the output.

5. If you don't see eth0, you may need to restart the network service or reboot:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
   ```
   
   If that doesn't work, a reboot should do it:
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

After these steps, your interface should be renamed to eth0. Let me know the results, and we can troubleshoot further if needed.

i have rebooted. no change.

 I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's troubleshoot this issue step by step:

1. First, let's verify the contents of the udev rule file:

   ```
   cat /etc/udev/rules.d/10-network.rules
   ```

   Ensure it contains the exact line we created earlier.

2. Let's try a more specific udev rule. Edit the file again:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-network.rules
   ```

   Replace the content with:

   ```
   SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{address}=="80:3f:5d:fb:45:5f", NAME="eth0"
   ```

   Note the changes: ATTR{address} became ATTRS{address}, and the MAC address is in lowercase.

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Now, let's check if udev recognizes our rule:

   ```
   sudo udevadm test /sys/class/net/enp101s0f4u1u4
   ```

   Look for any output related to renaming the interface.

5. If the test looks good, reload the rules and trigger udev:

   ```
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
   sudo udevadm trigger --attr-match=subsystem=net
   ```

6. Check the interface name again:

   ```
   ip link show
   ```

If you still don't see eth0, there might be other system configurations interfering. Let's check a couple more things:

7. Look for any other network naming rules:

   ```
   ls /etc/udev/rules.d/ | grep net
   ```

8. Check if predictable network interface names are enabled:

   ```
   ls -l /etc/systemd/network/99-default.link
   ```

   If this file exists, it might be enforcing the predictable naming scheme.

If none of these steps work, we might need to consider a different approach. Let me know the results, and we can proceed from there.
