Of what significance is a prefixed _ as it applies to programming. Labels I suppose?

 The underscore prefix (_) in programming has several important meanings depending on the language and context:

1. In Python, a single underscore prefix has two main uses:
```python
_internal_variable = 123  # Convention indicating "internal use" or "private"
# Other developers should treat this as implementation detail

for _ in range(5):  # Throwaway variable in loops
    print("Hello")  # _ indicates we don't need the loop variable
```

2. In Python, double underscore prefix causes name mangling:
```python
class MyClass:
    __private = "mangled"  # Will be transformed to _MyClass__private
```

3. In JavaScript, underscore prefix historically indicated private members (though now we have proper private fields with #):
```javascript
class Example {
    _private = "old convention"
    #actualPrivate = "modern private field"
}
```

4. In languages like Ruby, a single underscore prefix is similar to Python's convention for internal use.

The key point is that in most languages, the underscore prefix is a naming convention that signals to other developers "this is internal/private implementation detail - don't directly access this." However, it's often just a convention rather than a strict access control mechanism (with Python's double underscore and JavaScript's # being exceptions that actually enforce privacy).

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these uses or explain how they work in other programming languages?

Yeah, this was one such example. The other, it was when I was setting up opnsense. Assigning networks to aliases, I think? It's almost like _ was intended for hidden items?

 Ah yes! In both these cases, the underscore prefix serves a similar conceptual purpose - to indicate "special" or "system" items that should be treated differently from regular user content.

In Jekyll (as shown in your image), folders like `_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, etc. are special directories that Jekyll processes differently from regular content folders. These underscore-prefixed folders contain templates, configuration, and structural components rather than regular content pages.

For OPNsense, when dealing with network aliases, the underscore prefix is often used to denote system-reserved or special-purpose aliases that are managed by the system itself rather than user-created ones.

This pattern of using underscores to denote "special" or "system" items appears in many places in tech:
- Linux/Unix hidden files start with a dot (.)
- Many programming languages use underscore for internal/private members
- Database systems often use underscore prefixes for system tables
- Configuration files often use underscore prefixes (like _config.yml)

So you're right - while not always strictly "hidden," the underscore prefix often indicates "this is a special system thing, different from regular user content." It's a widely adopted convention across different technologies to mark special-purpose or system-managed elements.

Okay yeah! I kind of thought it would be similar in concept to .

**Assistant** - 2024-11-22 14:08:30 UTC

 Exactly! The underscore (_) and dot (.) prefixes serve very similar purposes conceptually - they're both conventions for marking special or system-related items, just in different contexts.

In Unix/Linux systems:
```bash
.bashrc        # Hidden config file
.ssh/          # Hidden directory
.gitignore     # Hidden git config
```

While in web/programming contexts:
```
_config.yml    # Jekyll system config
_private()     # Internal function
_layouts/      # System template directory
```

The main difference is that the dot (.) is more often used at the filesystem level in Unix-like systems to literally hide files from normal directory listings (they won't show up unless you use `ls -a`), while underscore (_) is more commonly used in programming contexts as a naming convention to indicate "special" status without actually hiding anything.

Would you like me to elaborate on any other similar conventions used in different tech contexts for marking special items? There are quite a few interesting patterns across different systems and languages.
