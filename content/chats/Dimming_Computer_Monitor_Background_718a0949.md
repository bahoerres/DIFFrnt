i'm trying to decide on a way to dim/filter the background of one of my computer monitors. i just want a plain transparent black filter over it. dim it down a bit, but leave the overall sceen brightness alone. 
am i going to be best doing that in a photo editor of some sort?

there wouldn't happen to be a magical windows feature would there? my asus laptop has a built in oled protecioin thing called target mode or something like that where the rest of the screen dims out except for the active window. but the desktop background filter, that was clutch.

 There are a few ways you could approach this:

1. Software solution:
   You're on the right track thinking about a photo editor. You could create a transparent black overlay using software like Photoshop, GIMP, or even Paint.NET. Create an image the size of your screen resolution, fill it with black, and adjust the opacity to your desired level of dimming. Then set this as your desktop background.

2. Windows built-in features:
   Unfortunately, Windows doesn't have a built-in feature specifically for dimming the desktop background while leaving application windows at full brightness. The closest native feature is Night Light, but that affects the entire screen.

3. Third-party software:
   There are applications designed for this purpose. Some options include:
   - F.lux: Primarily for adjusting color temperature, but it can also dim the screen.
   - Dimmer: A simple tool to overlay a transparent dark layer on your screen.
   - ClickMonitorDDC: Allows you to control monitor brightness via software.

4. Monitor settings:
   If your monitor has Picture-in-Picture (PIP) or Picture-by-Picture (PBP) modes, you might be able to use these creatively to achieve a similar effect.

The ASUS feature you mentioned (which sounds like OLED Care or similar) is indeed a nice touch, but it's manufacturer-specific and not a standard Windows feature.

For the most flexible and customizable solution, creating a semi-transparent overlay image and setting it as your desktop background is likely your best bet. This way, you can fine-tune the level of dimming exactly to your preference.

Would you like me to provide more details on any of these methods?

yeah, i had thought about f.lux. i've used it int he past and does a nice job.

 F.lux is indeed a good option, especially if you're already familiar with it. Since you've used it before, you might find it convenient to revisit. However, it's worth noting that F.lux is primarily designed for adjusting color temperature rather than selective dimming.

Given your specific goal of dimming just the background while leaving the overall screen brightness alone, you might want to consider a few other options:

1. Desktop Dimmer: This is a lightweight, free tool specifically designed to dim your desktop. It allows you to create a transparent overlay on your screen, which you can adjust to your preferred level of darkness.

2. AutoHotkey script: If you're comfortable with a bit of scripting, you could create a custom AutoHotkey script to generate a semi-transparent overlay on your desktop. This would give you precise control over the dimming level.

3. Rainmeter: This is a more advanced customization tool for Windows. You could create or find a skin that adds a semi-transparent layer to your desktop.

4. Custom wallpaper: As mentioned earlier, creating a custom semi-transparent black PNG image in a photo editor and setting it as your wallpaper could achieve the effect you're looking for. This method doesn't require any additional software running constantly.

5. Windows 11 Focus Sessions: If you're using Windows 11, the Focus Sessions feature in the Clock app can dim your desktop and hide taskbar notifications, though it may be more comprehensive than what you're looking for.

Would you like more information on any of these alternatives? Or if you're leaning towards using F.lux again, I can provide some tips on optimizing it for your specific use case.

 That's an interesting and somewhat unusual situation. If one of your monitors is immune to both f.lux and Windows Night Light, there could be a few reasons for this:

1. Monitor settings: Some monitors have their own color/brightness settings that can override software adjustments. Check your monitor's on-screen display (OSD) menu for any settings that might be interfering.

2. Graphics driver issues: Outdated or corrupted graphics drivers can sometimes cause inconsistent behavior across multiple monitors. Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date.

3. Monitor technology: Different monitor technologies (e.g., LCD, LED, OLED) can respond differently to software adjustments. Some high-end monitors with advanced color management might resist software-based changes.

4. Display port: The type of connection (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA) can sometimes affect how well software adjustments are applied. Try a different port if possible.

5. Windows display settings: Check your Windows display settings to ensure the problematic monitor isn't set to ignore color profiles or other adjustments.

Given this situation, you might want to consider solutions that work at the OS level rather than relying on color adjustment software. Here are a couple of options:

1. Screen dimming software: Try applications like "Dimmer" or "Monitorian" which work by applying an overlay to your screen rather than adjusting color temperatures.

2. Custom overlay: Create a semi-transparent black image in a photo editing software and use it as a screensaver or always-on-top window for that specific monitor.

3. Hardware solution: If software solutions aren't effective, you might consider using a privacy filter or light dimming film that you can physically apply to your monitor.

Would you like more details on any of these approaches? Or if you'd prefer, we could troubleshoot why that particular monitor isn't responding to f.lux and Night Light.
