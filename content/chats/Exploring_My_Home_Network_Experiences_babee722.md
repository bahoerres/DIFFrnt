i have an interesting one today. if i give you a bit of a monologue about my current home network, what i've done, what i've enjoyed and we sort of have a conversation about the experience. can you help me with a few projects? 

a documentation website - i'm currently trying to career change into a tech field. i feel like this would be beneficial as my primary career path previously was not tech. but i do have a strong enthusiast/hobbyist level interest in tech. and a fairly robust homelab/home network.

career path options - this will come more from our discussion on what i've done and what i've enjoyed, i'm sure. 

resume pointers/plans for growth and development. 

i would like to keep this conversational, short snippets, something that's as easy for you to digest as it is for me to convey.

 Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with those projects and have a conversation about your home network experiences. This sounds like a great way to explore your tech interests and potential career paths.

Let's start with your home network monologue. Feel free to share details about your setup, what you've done, and what you've enjoyed most. We can then use that information to discuss the documentation website, career path options, and resume pointers.

Please go ahead and tell me about your home network setup. What kind of equipment are you using? What projects have you tackled? What aspects have you found most interesting or enjoyable?
