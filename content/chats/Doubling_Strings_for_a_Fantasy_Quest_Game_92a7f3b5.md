looks like the coding program i'm working on has decided that we're going to be a little silly today. below is the assignment and the code that ours will be tested against. 

Double the string!
The fantasy quest team wants to add a new easter egg potion to Fantasy Quest! It causes characters to have their in-game chat manipulated when they send messages. The potion doubles every character they send!
* The message they type: `Hello there`
* The message that is sent: `HHeelllloo  tthheerree`
Assignment
Complete the `double_string` function. It takes a string as input and returns a "doubled" version, *including spaces*!
Example output

```py
sentence = "LF3M BRD full clear"
print(double_string(sentence)) # "LLFF33MM  BBRRDD  ffuullll  cclleeaarr"

```

Tip
You can iterate over a string as if it were a list of individual characters.

```py
string = "hello world"
for character in string:
    # process individual characters here

```



def main():
    passed = 0
    failed = 0
    for test_case in test_cases:
        correct = test(*test_case)
        if correct:
            passed += 1
        else:
            failed += 1
    if failed == 0:
        print("============= PASS ==============")
    else:
        print("============= FAIL ==============")
    print(f"{passed} passed, {failed} failed")
test_cases = submit_cases
if "__RUN__" in globals():
    test_cases = run_cases
main()

 I understand you're working on a coding assignment for a fantasy quest game, where you need to implement a function that doubles every character in a given string, including spaces. This is indeed a fun and somewhat silly task! Let's create the `double_string` function to solve this problem.

Here's the implementation of the `double_string` function:

```python
def double_string(string):
    return ''.join(char * 2 for char in string)
```

This function does the following:

1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string.
2. For each character, it multiplies it by 2 (which creates a string with that character repeated twice).
3. The `join` method is used to concatenate all these doubled characters into a single string.

This solution is concise and efficient. It will work for any input string, doubling all characters including spaces and special characters.

Would you like me to explain this code in more detail or provide some test cases to verify its functionality?

that's... very simple. nice. thank you.

 You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. You're right, it is a simple solution - sometimes the most elegant solutions are the simplest ones. 

The beauty of this approach is that it uses Python's built-in capabilities to handle the task efficiently. By using a list comprehension and the `join` method, we avoid explicit loops and temporary string concatenations, which can be less efficient.

If you have any more questions about this code or if you'd like to test it with some examples, feel free to ask. Good luck with your fantasy quest game project!
