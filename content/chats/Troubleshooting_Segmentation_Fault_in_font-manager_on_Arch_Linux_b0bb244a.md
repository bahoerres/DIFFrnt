font-manager 
fish: Job 1, 'font-manager' terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)

any idea what might be causing this? 

up to date system, arch linux, hyprland, kitty and fish as terminal.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:43:40 UTC

 This SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault) error with font-manager typically occurs due to memory access issues. On Arch Linux, there are a few common causes and potential solutions:

1. First, try clearing your font cache:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/fontconfig
fc-cache -f -v
```

2. Check if you have all the required dependencies:
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed gtk3 webkit2gtk libxml2 libsoup json-glib
```

3. If you're using the AUR version, try rebuilding it:
```bash
yay -S --rebuild font-manager
# or
paru -S --rebuild font-manager
```

4. The issue might also be related to Hyprland's handling of GTK applications. You could try:
   - Ensuring you have `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland` installed
   - Setting the appropriate environment variables in your Hyprland config:
```bash
env = GDK_BACKEND=wayland
env = GTK_THEME=your-theme-name
```

If none of these work, you could try:
1. Running it from a different terminal to rule out kitty-specific issues
2. Using the flatpak version instead: `flatpak install flathub org.gnome.FontManager`

Would you like me to help you debug this further with any of these approaches?

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:45:09 UTC

 Based on the output, the font cache was successfully rebuilt, but there are a few potential issues to note:

1. Several font directories are listed but don't exist:
   ```
   /home/blake/.local/share/fonts: skipping, no such directory
   /home/blake/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/fonts: skipping, no such directory
   /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/fonts: skipping, no such directory
   /usr/local/share/fonts: skipping, no such directory
   ```

2. The warning about "looped directory detected" isn't usually harmful but indicates some potential filesystem configuration issues.

Let's try launching font-manager again to see if clearing the cache fixed the issue. If it still crashes, let's verify your package dependencies:

```bash
pacman -Q gtk3 webkit2gtk libxml2 libsoup json-glib
```

Also, which version of font-manager are you using? You can check with:
```bash
pacman -Q font-manager
```

This will help us determine if this might be a version-specific issue or if we need to try other approaches.

**Human** - 2024-11-04 22:46:16 UTC

pacman -Q gtk3 webkit2gtk libxml2 libsoup json-glib
gtk3 1:3.24.43-4
error: package 'webkit2gtk' was not found
libxml2 2.13.4-1
error: package 'libsoup' was not found
json-glib 1.10.0-1

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:46:16 UTC

 Ah, there's the likely issue - you're missing some required dependencies. The package names have changed in recent Arch updates:

1. `webkit2gtk` is now `webkit2gtk-4.1`
2. `libsoup` is now `libsoup3`

Let's install the missing dependencies:

```bash
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1 libsoup3
```

After installing these dependencies, try running font-manager again. These libraries are crucial for font-manager's GUI functionality, and their absence could definitely cause a segmentation fault.

If it still crashes after installing these dependencies, let me know and we can try other troubleshooting steps.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:48:43 UTC

 Let's try a few more troubleshooting steps:

1. First, let's try running font-manager from the terminal with debug output:
```bash
font-manager --debug
```

2. We can also try checking if there are any relevant errors in your system logs:
```bash
journalctl -b | grep font-manager
```

3. Since you're using Hyprland, let's verify your portal settings. Check if you have these packages installed:
```bash
pacman -Q xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
```

4. Another option would be to try the Flatpak version to see if it's a packaging issue:
```bash
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.FontManager
```

Could you try the debug command and share any output before the crash? This would help pinpoint exactly where it's failing.

Also, what version of font-manager are you running? 
```bash
pacman -Q font-manager
```

 From the logs and debug output, we can see that the crash consistently occurs in `font_manager_load_user_font_resources` when trying to load the font list. This appears to be a fontconfig-related crash, possibly due to some corrupt font files or font cache issues.

Let's try a more thorough approach:

1. First, backup and remove your existing font configuration:
```bash
mv ~/.config/fontconfig ~/.config/fontconfig.bak
```

2. Check for and remove any broken symlinks in your font directories:
```bash
find ~/.fonts /usr/share/fonts -xtype l
```

3. Rebuild fontconfig completely:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/cache/fontconfig/*
sudo fc-cache -rfsv
```

4. Since you're using Hyprland, let's also make sure your environment variables are set correctly. Add these to your Hyprland config if they're not already there:
```bash
env = GDK_BACKEND,wayland
env = GTK_USE_PORTAL,1
env = XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP,Hyprland
env = XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP,Hyprland
```

5. As a last resort, we could try the Flatpak version which might avoid these system-level font issues:
```bash
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.FontManager
```

Let me know if you want to try any of these approaches, and we can work through them step by step.

Also, what's the output of:
```bash
pacman -Q fontconfig
```

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:53:42 UTC

 Looking at the version and previous logs, this might be related to a known issue with font-manager 0.9.0 and newer versions of fontconfig on GTK4. Let's try the flatpak version which might have better compatibility:

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.FontManager
```

After installation, you can run it with:
```bash
flatpak run org.gnome.FontManager
```

If you prefer not to use flatpak, there's also an older version (0.8.8) in the AUR that uses GTK3 and might be more stable:
```bash
yay -S font-manager-gtk3
# or
paru -S font-manager-gtk3
```

Would you like to try either of these alternatives? The flatpak version would be the safest bet since it runs in its own container with its own dependencies.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-04 22:53:42 UTC

pacman -Q font-manager 
font-manager 0.9.0-2

---

**Human** - 2024-11-04 22:54:44 UTC

and apologies, this is what you actually asked for (multiple times..)

~ î‚° pacman -Q fontconfig
fontconfig 2:2.15.0-2

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:54:44 UTC

 Thanks for providing that. With fontconfig 2.15.0 and font-manager 0.9.0, this is likely a version mismatch issue that's causing the segfault. Font-manager 0.9.0 appears to have some compatibility issues with newer versions of fontconfig, particularly on Wayland/Hyprland setups.

Let's try the Flatpak version first since it will come with its own controlled environment and dependencies:

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.FontManager
flatpak run org.gnome.FontManager
```

If you want to stick with the native package, we can try downgrading fontconfig to an earlier version:
```bash
sudo pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/fontconfig-2.14.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

(If the package isn't in your cache, we can find an alternative approach.)

Which approach would you prefer to try first?

**Human** - 2024-11-04 22:56:07 UTC

if installing flatpak i can remove font-manager? fontconfig too? or is that still a dependency?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:56:07 UTC

 Don't remove fontconfig - it's a critical system dependency that many other applications rely on. It's used by virtually all GUI applications for font rendering.

You can safely remove the native font-manager package though:

```bash
sudo pacman -R font-manager
```

Then proceed with the Flatpak installation:
```bash
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.FontManager
```

The Flatpak version will use its own contained version of dependencies while running, but won't interfere with your system's fontconfig installation, which needs to stay in place for other applications to work properly.

**Human** - 2024-11-04 22:57:08 UTC

oh my.. could this have been the issue all along? this is the end of the flatpak install:

Installation complete.
bwrap: Can't find source path /home/blake/.local/share/fonts: No such file or directory

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:57:08 UTC

 Ah, that warning suggests your ~/.local/share/fonts directory doesn't exist, which matches what we saw earlier in the fc-cache output. While this warning itself isn't breaking the Flatpak installation, creating this directory might help with font management in general:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
```

This is actually a standard location for user-installed fonts in Linux, and its absence might have been contributing to the crashes in the native font-manager package.

Try creating the directory and then running the Flatpak version:
```bash
flatpak run org.gnome.FontManager
```

If this works, it suggests the original crashes might have been related to font-manager trying to access a non-existent directory. This is actually a bug in the native package - it should handle missing directories more gracefully rather than segfaulting.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-04 22:59:29 UTC

 Ah yes - there's the issue! You have a symlink for your fonts directory pointing to `../../dotfiles/fonts/.local/share/fonts`. If that target directory doesn't exist or isn't properly set up, it would cause the exact kind of segfault we're seeing.

Let's check a few things:

1. Verify if the target directory exists:
```bash
ls -la ~/dotfiles/fonts/.local/share/fonts
```

2. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to either:
   a. Create the target directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/dotfiles/fonts/.local/share/fonts
   ```
   OR
   b. Remove the symlink and create a regular directory:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.local/share/fonts
   mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts
   ```

This symlink setup is likely what was causing font-manager to crash - it was following the symlink but finding nothing at the destination, leading to the segfault. fontconfig and font-manager should handle missing directories more gracefully, but they don't always do so.
