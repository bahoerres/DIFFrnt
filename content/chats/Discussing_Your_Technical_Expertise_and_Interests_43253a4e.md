I've got an interview question asking about connectwise. While I don't have experience with that specific suite, I probably have some experience with something similar, or at least components of.. can we explore this a bit?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-18 20:40:25 UTC

 Certainly! Let's explore your experience with tools and systems that might be similar to ConnectWise. ConnectWise is a suite of software tools primarily used by Managed Service Providers (MSPs) for various aspects of their business, including:

1. Professional Services Automation (PSA)
2. Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)
3. Help Desk and Ticketing
4. Project Management
5. Time Tracking and Billing
6. Remote Control and Access

Given your background in networking, security, and homelab management, you likely have experience with tools or concepts that align with some of these functions. Let's break it down:

1. Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM):
   - In your homelab, you've likely set up monitoring systems. Have you used tools like Nagios, Zabbix, or Prometheus for monitoring your network and servers?
   - Your experience with OPNsense might include setting up and monitoring network traffic, which is a key aspect of RMM.

2. Help Desk and Ticketing:
   - While you might not have used enterprise ticketing systems, have you set up any personal task management or issue tracking systems in your homelab? Tools like Jira, Trello, or even GitHub Issues for personal projects?

3. Remote Control and Access:
   - Your advanced network segmentation work suggests experience with remote access. Have you set up VPNs or used tools like SSH for remote management?

4. Project Management:
   - Your career transition and homelab projects likely involved some form of project management. Have you used any specific tools or methodologies to manage your learning or project implementation?

5. Time Tracking:
   - In your journey of continuous learning and project implementation, have you used any time tracking tools to measure and optimize your efforts?

6. Automation:
   - ConnectWise emphasizes automation. Your experience with OPNsense and Proxmox likely involved scripting and automation. Have you used tools like Ansible, Puppet, or written custom scripts to automate tasks in your homelab?

Let's explore these areas to identify experiences that might be relevant to ConnectWise-like functionality. This will help you draw parallels between your existing knowledge and the capabilities of ConnectWise, even if you haven't used that specific suite.

Prometheus, and then by association Grafana/Loki, but only in as much as setting up containers to run them, I haven't dug too deep into their own use. 

But you're correct, vpns, remote access including tools like ssh, those I know. 

Is for some of the higher level mentions, I know of, and sort of understand ansible. I'm familiar with the purpose of it, I suppose. 

While I haven't seen any issues on any of my own code, I have seen them in action on the repos that I keep track of for my own use. And a long history in restaurants gives me plenty of understanding of how that form of tickets and the flow works. 

Oh, project management. Notion, Trello, todoist, Google suite, teams. Components of all of them, id imagine.

 Excellent! You've got a solid foundation that aligns well with many aspects of ConnectWise-like functionality. Let's synthesize this information to help you articulate your relevant experience:

1. Monitoring and Observability:
   "While I haven't extensively used ConnectWise, I have experience setting up monitoring and observability stacks using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. This gives me a strong understanding of the principles behind remote monitoring and management systems."

2. Remote Access and Management:
   "I'm well-versed in setting up and managing secure remote access solutions, including VPNs and SSH. This experience directly relates to the remote control and access features of platforms like ConnectWise."

3. Automation and Configuration Management:
