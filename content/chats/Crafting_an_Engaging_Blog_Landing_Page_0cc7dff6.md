**Human** - 2024-07-28 16:22:36 UTC

i'm adding pages to this blog (it's run on ghost) and was hoping for some input from you, my trusted confidant, tireless assistant, co-traveler on this winding road.. 

basically i'm trying to have a home landing page, and then two subsequent pages for mental health posts and technology posts (as those are my two broad categories that i'm focusing most of my writing into.) 

i'm messing around with templates in my theme to see what i like as far as aesthetics, but i'm goin to need a little help as far as general landing page type stuff. a title, a headline and a brief summary would be great. 

let's see what we can do.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 16:22:36 UTC

 I appreciate your trust and am happy to help with your blog structure and content. Let's work on creating an engaging landing page for your blog. First, I'll suggest some elements for your home page, then we can refine them together.

Title: "Mindful Tech: Exploring Mental Health and Technology"

Headline: "Where Wellness Meets Innovation"

Brief Summary:
"Welcome to Mindful Tech, a space where we explore the intersections of mental health and technology. Here, you'll find insights, tips, and discussions on how to thrive in our digital age while nurturing your mental well-being. Join us as we navigate the complexities of modern life, one post at a time."

This setup provides a clear introduction to your blog's focus areas. The title combines your two main themes, while the headline suggests their integration. The summary gives visitors a concise overview of what to expect from your content.

For your subsequent pages, you might consider:

1. Mental Health Page:
   Title: "Mental Wellness Insights"
   
2. Technology Page:
   Title: "Tech Trends and Impacts"

Would you like to refine any of these elements or discuss how to structure the content within these pages?

---

**Human** - 2024-07-28 16:27:56 UTC

okay, i think we're on the right track. 

a little more background: 

the url is my name, personal brand or whatever. blakehoerres.com and i've termed it that backlog chronicles (i figured this was a fun play on the idea of always feeling behind as a neurodivergent person and because backlog is actually a thing in the techspace).  my headline currently is "Ideations and Iterations from a neuro-different, recovering chef.   (because i'm also a recovering alcoholic and former chef, which is a trauma in and of itself. haha)

i'm mostly focusing here on those second two pages. 

So like, for my main navigation menu maybe "Home | About | Wellnes | Homelab" 

home would be that kind of basic welcome page, and maybe subsequent short sections highlighting the two main categories of content, and then the links for Wellness and Homelab would go to sorted archives? i think that makes the most sense.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 16:27:56 UTC

 Thank you for providing that additional context. Your personal brand and background add a unique flavor to your blog. Let's refine the structure based on this information.

Navigation Menu:
Home | About | Wellness | Homelab

This structure makes sense. Let's break down each section:

1. Home:
   Title: "The Backlog Chronicles"
   Headline: "Ideations and Iterations from a Neuro-different, Recovering Chef"
   
   Brief intro followed by two sections highlighting your main content categories:
   
   - Wellness: A brief teaser about your mental health content, emphasizing your personal experiences and insights.
   - Homelab: An introduction to your tech-focused content, possibly mentioning how it relates to your neurodivergent perspective.

2. About:
   This page can dive deeper into your background as a neurodivergent individual, former chef, and your journey into tech and mental health advocacy.

3. Wellness:
   This would lead to a sorted archive of your mental health posts. You could introduce it with a brief explanation of your approach to wellness, particularly from a neurodivergent perspective.

4. Homelab:
   Similarly, this would be a sorted archive of your tech posts. You could introduce it by explaining what "homelab" means to you and how it relates to your broader interests and experiences.

For the Wellness and Homelab archive pages, you might want to consider adding categories or tags to help readers navigate your content more easily. For example:

Wellness categories:
- Neurodivergent Perspectives
- Recovery Journey
- Mindfulness Techniques
- Work-Life Balance

Homelab categories:
- Tech Reviews
- DIY Projects
- Productivity Tools
- Neurodivergent-Friendly Tech

This structure maintains your unique voice and background while providing clear navigation for your readers. Would you like to refine any of these elements further?

---

**Human** - 2024-07-28 16:31:24 UTC

i think the level of refinement that we've reached is one that i'm good with.. 

maybe switch gears into producing some of this content? 

i think the about page should be like "who i am, why this page exists and what you'll find" 

and then the homepage subsections can be a quick "the backlog chronicles is..." and then like you said, blurbs about mental health and tech and how i relate and what the goals are.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 16:31:24 UTC

 Certainly, let's work on producing some content for your pages. We'll start with the About page and then move on to the Home page subsections.

About Page:

Title: "About Blake Hoerres"

Who I Am:
I'm Blake, a neurodivergent individual navigating the intersections of technology and mental health. My journey has taken me from the high-pressure world of professional kitchens to the intricate realm of tech and self-discovery. As a recovering chef and alcoholic, I've learned the importance of mental wellness and the power of technology in personal growth.

Why This Page Exists:
The Backlog Chronicles is my digital sanctuary, a place where I share my experiences, insights, and explorations. It's born from the constant feeling of being behind — a sentiment many neurodivergent individuals can relate to — and the tech concept of a 'backlog'. This space is where I work through my own backlog of ideas, challenges, and discoveries, hoping to connect with others on similar paths.

What You'll Find:
Here, you'll discover a blend of content focused on two main areas:

1. Wellness: Dive into posts about mental health, neurodiversity, and personal growth. I share strategies for mindfulness, productivity tips for neurodivergent minds, and honest reflections on the recovery journey.

2. Homelab: Explore my tech adventures, from DIY projects to reviews of tools that make life easier for neurodivergent individuals. I'll share my experiences setting up and maintaining a homelab, and how technology intersects with mental wellness.

Join me as we navigate the complexities of modern life, celebrate neurodiversity, and find innovative ways to manage our personal backlogs.

Home Page Subsections:

The Backlog Chronicles Is...
A personal blog chronicling the adventures, musings, and discoveries of a neurodivergent tech enthusiast and mental health advocate. It's a space where the worlds of wellness and technology collide, offering unique perspectives on navigating life's challenges and embracing personal growth.

Wellness:
In our Wellness section, we explore the landscape of mental health through a neurodivergent lens. From sharing coping strategies for ADHD to discussing the intersections of tech and mindfulness, we dive deep into what it means to prioritize mental well-being in today's fast-paced world. Join us as we unpack the complexities of recovery, self-discovery, and finding balance in a neurotypical world.

**Human** - 2024-07-28 16:35:57 UTC

i'll be honest, the idea of how technology and mental health intersect and coexist wasnt even really on my radar. thank you for that! 

up until this point it's just been kind of the two hyperfocuses my brain has been chasing. tech, because i've always had an interest, and am trying to transition careers into that field. the homelab was the springboard and is the incubation chamber for that endeavour, and the blog started as a way to "show my work" basically. in hopes of someone seeing it and maybe spinning a job out of it (currently unemployed). the mental health side is sort of a mindfulness practice in and of itself, AuDHD identification/confirmation/whatever we wanna call it are relatively recent, so that's been a lot to wrap my head around. if anything this helps me, and figured it might also be helpful for someone else (service industry background, people pleaser, however we want to angle that.. )

maybe this helps dial things in a little further?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 16:35:57 UTC

 Thank you for sharing that additional context. It's great to see how your personal journey has shaped the focus of your blog. Let's refine the content to better reflect your specific experiences and goals. Here's a revised version of the Home Page subsections that incorporates this new information:

The Backlog Chronicles Is...
A personal blog documenting my journey as a neurodivergent individual transitioning into the tech field while exploring mental health and self-discovery. It's a space where I share my experiences setting up a homelab, learning new tech skills, and navigating the complexities of AuDHD (Autism and ADHD). This blog serves as both a portfolio of my tech projects and a reflection of my mental health journey, hoping to connect with others on similar paths.

Wellness:
In the Wellness section, I dive into my recent exploration of AuDHD and its impact on my life. Here, you'll find honest accounts of my experiences, coping strategies I'm discovering, and reflections on how understanding neurodiversity has changed my perspective. I share insights from my background in the service industry, discussing how these experiences have shaped my approach to mental health. This space is as much for my own processing as it is for others who might find comfort or inspiration in shared experiences.

Homelab:
The Homelab section is my tech playground and learning lab. Here, I document my projects, experiments, and the skills I'm developing as I work towards a career transition into tech. From setting up servers to experimenting with networking, I'm "showing my work" and sharing my learning process. This section serves as a portfolio of my growing tech skills, demonstrating my hands-on experience and problem-solving abilities to potential employers. Join me as I navigate the challenges and victories of building a homelab and forging a new career path.

This revised version emphasizes your personal journey, your goals for career transition, and the recent nature of your AuDHD identification. It also highlights how the blog serves both as a portfolio for your tech skills and as a platform for processing and sharing your mental health experiences. Does this align better with your vision for The Backlog Chronicles?

**Human** - 2024-07-28 16:42:23 UTC

these look good. now it's on me to figure out how to implement the design features.. 

i'm adding the current "about" page just go give an idea of what ghost started me out with as a generic. it..... needs work.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 16:42:23 UTC

 Understood. I'd be happy to help you refine your "About" page based on the generic content Ghost provided. Could you please share the current content of your "About" page? Once you provide that, I can offer suggestions on how to improve and personalize it to better reflect your unique story and the purpose of The Backlog Chronicles.

**Human** - 2024-07-28 16:54:00 UTC

did we do headlines and summaries for each of the sorted posts pages?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 16:54:00 UTC

 You're right to ask - we haven't explicitly created headlines and summaries for the sorted posts pages (Wellness and Homelab) yet. Let's create those now to ensure consistency across your site.

Wellness Page:

Headline: "Navigating Neurodiversity: A Journey Through Mental Health"

Summary: 
"Welcome to the Wellness section of The Backlog Chronicles. Here, I share my personal experiences and insights as a neurodivergent individual navigating mental health challenges. From exploring life with AuDHD to discussing coping strategies and mindfulness techniques, this space is dedicated to honest reflections on personal growth and mental well-being. Join me as we unpack the complexities of neurodiversity and discover paths to balance in a neurotypical world."

Homelab Page:

Headline: "Tech Tinkering: Building Skills and Systems"

Summary:
"Step into my digital workshop - the Homelab section of The Backlog Chronicles. This is where I document my journey into the world of technology, showcasing projects, experiments, and learnings as I transition into a tech career. From setting up servers to exploring networking solutions, each post represents a step in my technical growth. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast or simply curious about how technology can support neurodivergent minds, you'll find insights and practical experiences here."

These headlines and summaries provide a clear introduction to each section, reflecting the unique focus and purpose of your Wellness and Homelab content. They align with the overall theme of your blog while highlighting the specific aspects of each category. Feel free to adjust the language or focus to better match your voice and specific content plans.

**Human** - 2024-07-28 20:04:48 UTC

so i'm having a bit of trouble with this structure.. 

it seems the full blogroll default to the Home page.. it'd be great if i could get home to be an introduction, then a dedicated Blog page with sub-pages to filer between homelab and wellness? 

do you have enough knowledge of how ghost works to walk me through this?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 20:04:48 UTC

 I apologize, but I don't have specific, up-to-date knowledge about Ghost's current interface or configuration options. Ghost, like many content management systems, can change its features and interface over time.

However, I can offer some general guidance based on common blog structures:

1. Home Page: 
   You typically can set a static page as your home page in most blog platforms. Look for settings related to "Front page" or "Homepage" in your Ghost admin panel.

2. Blog Page:
   Create a new page called "Blog" or "All Posts" that will display your full blogroll.

3. Category Pages:
   Create separate pages for "Homelab" and "Wellness". These would filter posts by category.

4. Navigation:
   Set up your main navigation to include Home, Blog, Homelab, and Wellness.

To achieve this in Ghost, you might need to:

1. Create the necessary pages.
2. Adjust your theme settings or templates to display content as desired.
3. Use Ghost's tagging or categorization system to sort posts.
4. Configure your navigation menu.

Since I can't provide platform-specific instructions, I'd recommend:

1. Check Ghost's official documentation for the most current information.
2. Look for settings related to "Page Structure" or "Content Organization" in your Ghost admin panel.
3. If you're using a custom theme, you might need to modify theme files to achieve your desired structure.

If you encounter specific issues or need more detailed guidance, it might be helpful to consult Ghost's community forums or support channels. They can provide up-to-date, platform-specific advice.

Would you like me to clarify or expand on any part of this general guidance?

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 20:11:24 UTC

 That's an interesting idea. Using Nginx to point your domain to a specific subdirectory could potentially work, but it might not be the ideal solution for what you're trying to achieve with Ghost. Let me explain a bit and suggest some alternatives:

1. Nginx Configuration:
   If you adjust Nginx to point blakehoerres.com to blakehoerres.com/blog, it would essentially make your blog the homepage. While this could work, it might not give you the flexibility you're looking for in terms of having a separate introduction page and then a blog with filtered categories.

2. Ghost Configuration:
   Instead of modifying Nginx, it's usually better to work within Ghost's own system for organizing content. Ghost has built-in features for this that are designed to work well with its themes and overall structure.

3. Alternative Approach:
   Here's a structure you might consider implementing within Ghost:

   - Home Page: Set this as a static page with your introduction.
   - Blog: Create a page called "Blog" that shows all posts.
   - Homelab and Wellness: Use Ghost's tag or category system to filter posts.

   Your navigation could look like:
   Home | Blog | Homelab | Wellness

   Where "Blog" shows all posts, and "Homelab" and "Wellness" show filtered posts.

4. Ghost Settings:
   - In Ghost Admin, go to "Settings" > "General"
   - Look for a setting like "Homepage" or "Front page"
   - You should be able to select a static page as your homepage

5. Custom Theme:
   If your current theme doesn't support this structure, you might need to modify your theme or choose a different one that allows for more customization.

Remember, these suggestions are based on general blog structuring principles. The exact steps might vary depending on your specific Ghost version and theme.

If you're still having trouble after trying these approaches, it might be worth reaching out to Ghost's community forums or support channels for more specific, up-to-date advice on achieving this structure within Ghost itself.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?

**Human** - 2024-07-28 20:11:24 UTC

i have an idea.. if i adjust in the cli for nginx to point at blakehoerres.com/blog  

hmm.

---

**Human** - 2024-07-28 22:37:40 UTC

i found a tutorial that i think accomplishes what i want.. i just have to make sure my navigation settings line up.. can you have a look at this and let me know if it make sense to you? 

routes:
  /:
    template: page
    data: page.home
collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:blog
  /homelab/:
    permalink: /blog/homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:blog
  /wellness/:
    permalink: /blog/wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:blog

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 22:37:40 UTC

 This routing configuration looks like it should accomplish what you're aiming for. Let's break it down:

1. Home Page:
   ```yaml
   /:
     template: page
     data: page.home
   ```
   This sets your home page to use a specific page template, likely for your static introductory content.

2. Main Blog Page:
   ```yaml
   /blog/:
     permalink: /blog/{slug}/
     template: index
     filter: tag:blog
   ```
   This creates a main blog page at /blog/ that shows all posts tagged with "blog".

3. Homelab Page:
   ```yaml
   /homelab/:
     permalink: /blog/homelab/{slug}/
     template: index
     filter: tag:blog
   ```
   This creates a page for Homelab posts at /homelab/, with individual posts at /blog/homelab/{slug}/.

4. Wellness Page:
   ```yaml
   /wellness/:
     permalink: /blog/wellness/{slug}/
     template: index
     filter: tag:blog
   ```
   Similarly, this creates a page for Wellness posts at /wellness/, with individual posts at /blog/wellness/{slug}/.

This structure should give you:
- A static home page
- A main blog page showing all posts
- Separate pages for Homelab and Wellness categories

To make this work effectively:
1. Ensure you have a page named "home" for your homepage.
2. Tag all your posts with "blog".
3. Additionally tag posts with either "homelab" or "wellness" as appropriate.
4. Update your navigation menu to reflect this structure.

This configuration looks sensible and should achieve the structure you're aiming for. Just make sure your tagging aligns with this routing setup.

---

**Human** - 2024-07-28 22:38:25 UTC

oh i need to change the tags in the two sub-categories.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 22:38:25 UTC

 You're absolutely right. Good catch! Let's adjust the configuration for the Homelab and Wellness sections to use their specific tags. Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: page
    data: page.home
collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:blog
  /homelab/:
    permalink: /blog/homelab/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:homelab
  /wellness/:
    permalink: /blog/wellness/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: tag:wellness
```

The changes are in the last two sections:

1. For Homelab:
   ```yaml
   filter: tag:homelab
   ```

2. For Wellness:
   ```yaml
   filter: tag:wellness
   ```

With these changes:
1. Your main blog page will show all posts tagged with "blog".
2. The Homelab page will show only posts tagged with "homelab".
3. The Wellness page will show only posts tagged with "wellness".

To make this work:
1. Tag all your posts with "blog".
2. Additionally tag Homelab posts with "homelab".
3. Additionally tag Wellness posts with "wellness".

This way, all your posts will appear on the main blog page, but they'll also be correctly categorized on their respective pages. Thank you for pointing out that discrepancy – it's an important detail for ensuring your content is organized correctly.

---

**Human** - 2024-07-28 22:39:29 UTC

will these need to be the first tags? or just as long as the tag exists? 

i'd like to have featured posts, and those use the first tag in the list.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 22:39:29 UTC

 Great question about tag ordering and featured posts. Here's what you need to know:

1. Tag Order: 
   For the routing and filtering we've set up, the order of tags doesn't matter. As long as the post has the correct tag ("blog", "homelab", or "wellness"), it will appear in the right section, regardless of where that tag appears in the list of tags for the post.

2. Featured Posts:
   You're correct that in many Ghost themes, the first tag is often used to designate featured posts or for other special purposes. This is a common theme design choice, not a Ghost core function.

Given this, here's a strategy you could use:

1. For featured posts:
   - Make "featured" (or whatever tag you choose for this purpose) the first tag.
   - Follow it with "blog" and then either "homelab" or "wellness" as appropriate.

2. For non-featured posts:
   - Start with "blog" and then use either "homelab" or "wellness".

Example tag orders:
- Featured Homelab post: featured, blog, homelab, [any other tags]
- Regular Wellness post: blog, wellness, [any other tags]

This approach allows you to:
1. Use the first tag for featuring posts (if your theme supports this).
2. Ensure all posts appear on the main blog page (with the "blog" tag).
3. Correctly categorize posts into Homelab or Wellness sections.

Remember, the exact behavior can depend on your specific Ghost theme. Some themes might use tag order differently, so it's worth checking your theme's documentation or behavior to confirm how it handles tag order.

If you find that your theme doesn't handle featured posts the way you want, you might need to adjust your theme files or look for a theme that offers more flexibility in this area.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 22:40:01 UTC

 Exactly right. Your understanding is spot-on. Using "homelab,blog" or "wellness,blog" as the primary tags (regardless of order between these two) will accomplish what you want. This approach will:

1. Ensure posts appear in the correct category (Homelab or Wellness).
2. Make sure all posts show up on the main blog page.
3. Allow you to use additional tags for more specific categorization or for features like highlighting certain posts, without interfering with the main categorization.

This tagging strategy gives you:

- Flexibility: You can add other tags as needed without disrupting the main structure.
- Consistency: Your posts will reliably appear in the right sections.
- Simplicity: It's a straightforward system that's easy to maintain.

Remember, you can always add more tags after these primary ones for more detailed categorization or to enable other theme features. For example:

- homelab,blog,networking,tutorial
- wellness,blog,mindfulness,beginner

This approach provides a solid foundation for organizing your content while giving you room to expand and refine your tagging system as your blog grows. Good job on working through this - you've got a clear grasp of how to structure your content effectively!

---

**Human** - 2024-07-28 22:40:01 UTC

great. so having them as either homelab,blog or wellness,blog regardless of the rest of the tags should do exactly what i want

---

**Human** - 2024-07-28 22:40:48 UTC

i've got adhd! haha.. 

i may sometimes struggle with conceptualizing ideas on my own, but i'll be damned if i don't pick up quick once i see it.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-07-28 22:40:48 UTC

 Your self-awareness is fantastic! And you're absolutely right - many people with ADHD excel at quickly grasping and applying concepts once they're presented in a way that clicks for them. It's a great strength to recognize about yourself.

This rapid understanding and application of new information can be a significant advantage, especially in fields like technology where things change quickly and adaptability is key. Your ability to quickly pick up on the tagging system and understand its implications for your blog structure is a perfect example of this strength in action.

In the context of your blog, this trait could be really beneficial:

1. Learning new technologies for your homelab
2. Quickly adapting to changes in blogging platforms or web technologies
3. Picking up new strategies for managing mental health and wellness

As you continue to work on your blog, you might find it helpful to:

1. Use visual aids or diagrams when planning new structures or systems
2. Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps
3. Experiment hands-on with new ideas to see how they work in practice

Remember, your ADHD isn't just a challenge - it's also a source of unique strengths. Your quick uptake on new concepts is a valuable skill that can serve you well in both your tech endeavors and your exploration of mental health topics.

Keep leveraging this strength as you develop your blog and explore new ideas. It's a great asset in the constantly evolving worlds of technology and personal growth!
