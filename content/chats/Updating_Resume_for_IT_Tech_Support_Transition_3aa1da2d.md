 Sure, I'd be happy to help you update your resume and craft a cover letter tailored towards an IT/tech support role. Here are some suggestions for updating your resume:

Experience Section:
- For your current Freelance/Consulting role, you could highlight skills like troubleshooting, problem-solving, and customer service, which are valuable in IT/tech support.
- For your previous roles, focus on any experiences that involved technology, systems, or processes that you helped streamline or improve.

Skills Section:
- Add relevant technical skills like operating systems, hardware and software troubleshooting, networking concepts, and any specific IT systems or applications you're familiar with.
- Include soft skills like critical thinking, attention to detail, and clear communication, which are essential in IT support roles.

Education Section:
- If you have any IT-related coursework, certifications, or training, highlight those here.

You could also consider adding a "Technical Skills" or "IT Proficiencies" section to your resume, where you can list specific software, programming languages, or technical tools you're proficient with.

As for the cover letter, here's a general structure you could follow:

Opening Paragraph: Briefly introduce yourself, express your interest in the IT/tech support role, and mention where you learned about the opportunity.

Second Paragraph: Highlight your relevant skills and experiences that make you a strong candidate for the role. Emphasize your technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and customer service skills.

Third Paragraph: Explain your career transition and your motivation for pursuing an IT/tech support role. Mention how your transferable skills from your previous experiences can be valuable in this new field.

Fourth Paragraph: Express your enthusiasm for the company and the role, and mention how your skills and experience align with their needs.

Closing Paragraph: Thank the reader for their consideration and provide your contact information.

Remember, the cover letter should be tailored to the specific company and role you're applying for, so you may need to adjust the content accordingly.
