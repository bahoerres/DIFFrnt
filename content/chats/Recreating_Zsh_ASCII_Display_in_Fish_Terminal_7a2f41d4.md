when i initially set up this ml4w - i guess, "prefab" - hyprland config, i got a fun ascii display when i opened the terminal (it was originally zsh). 

i've since switched to fish and have lost that neat little bit. i don't know if it is contained in the files i've attached, but i figured these would be good places to start in order to get fish to dislplay in the same manner.

 I understand you're looking to recreate a fun ASCII display that you previously had when using zsh, but now you've switched to fish and lost that feature. Let's take a look at the files you've provided and see how we can help you set up something similar in fish.

<antThinking>The .zshrc file contains an ASCII art and some configuration details. This is substantial content that could be useful for the user to modify or reference later, making it a good candidate for an artifact. I'll create a new artifact to highlight the relevant parts.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="zshrc-ascii-art" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="ASCII art from .zshrc">
#            _              
#    _______| |__  _ __ ___ 
#   |_  / __| '_ \| '__/ __|
#  _ / /\__ \ | | | | | (__ 
# (_)___|___/_| |_|_|  \___|
#                           
# -----------------------------------------------------
# ML4W zshrc loader
# -----------------------------------------------------

# DON'T CHANGE THIS FILE

# You can define your custom configuration by adding
# files in ~/.config/zshrc 
# or by creating a folder ~/.config/zshrc/custom
# with you own zshrc configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------
</antArtifact>

The ASCII art and configuration comments you're looking for are indeed in the .zshrc file. However, since you've switched to fish, we'll need to adapt this for your fish configuration. Here's what you can do:

1. Create or edit your fish configuration file:
   Usually, this is located at `~/.config/fish/config.fish`. The file you provided is mostly empty, so we'll add to it.

2. Add the ASCII art and any welcome message you want to your `config.fish` file. Here's how you can do it:

<antArtifact identifier="fish-config-ascii" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Updated config.fish with ASCII art">
if status is-interactive
    # Commands to run in interactive sessions can go here
    
    # ASCII Art
    echo '            _              '
    echo '    _______| |__  _ __ ___ '
    echo '   |_  / __| \'_\\ | \'__/ __|'
    echo '  _ / /\__ \ | | | | | (__ '
    echo ' (_)___|___/_| |_|_|  \___|'
    echo '                           '
    echo '-----------------------------------------------------'
    echo 'Welcome to Fish Shell!'
    echo '-----------------------------------------------------'
end
</antArtifact>

3. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish` to see the changes.

This will display the ASCII art and welcome message every time you open a new interactive fish shell.

If you want to make it more dynamic or have more complex logic (like the zsh configuration that sources multiple files), you can create separate fish functions or source additional fish script files.

Would you like me to explain how to create separate fish functions or source additional files, similar to how your zsh configuration was set up?

i am also using oh-my-fish but i dont see much in the way of config files for it..

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 21:33:19 UTC

 Ah, I see. You're using Oh My Fish (OMF), which is a framework for managing your fish shell configuration. It's similar to Oh My Zsh for the Zsh shell. Let's work with that to set up your ASCII art and any other customizations you want.

With Oh My Fish, the configuration is typically managed differently than a standard Fish setup. Here's how we can approach this:

1. First, let's check if you have a custom configuration file for Oh My Fish. It's usually located at `~/.config/omf/init.fish`. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.

2. We'll use this file to add your custom ASCII art and any other initialization you want.

Here's what you can do:

<antThinking>Creating an Oh My Fish configuration file with ASCII art and customization options is a good candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, likely to be modified, and represents a standalone piece of work.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="omf-init-fish" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Oh My Fish init.fish with ASCII art">
# ~/.config/omf/init.fish

function fish_greeting
    echo '            _              '
    echo '    _______| |__  _ __ ___ '
    echo '   |_  / __| \'_\\ | \'__/ __|'
    echo '  _ / /\__ \ | | | | | (__ '
    echo ' (_)___|___/_| |_|_|  \___|'
    echo '                           '
    echo '-----------------------------------------------------'
    echo 'Welcome to Fish Shell with Oh My Fish!'
    echo '-----------------------------------------------------'
end

# You can add more custom configurations here
# For example:
# set -gx PATH $HOME/bin $PATH

# Load any custom functions
if test -d $HOME/.config/omf/functions
    for f in $HOME/.config/omf/functions/*.fish
        source $f
    end
end

# Any other customizations you want to add
</antArtifact>

Now, let me explain the components of this setup:

1. We define a custom `fish_greeting` function. This is what Fish will run when starting an interactive session, replacing the default greeting.

2. The ASCII art is included in this greeting function.

3. I've added a section for custom PATH modifications if you need them.

4. There's a block that will source any custom function files you create in `~/.config/omf/functions/`. This is similar to how your Zsh setup was sourcing multiple files.

To use this setup:

1. Create the file `~/.config/omf/init.fish` if it doesn't exist, and paste the content from the artifact above into it.

2. If you want to add more custom functions, you can create them in `~/.config/omf/functions/` with a `.fish` extension, and they'll be automatically sourced.

3. Restart your terminal or run `omf reload` to see the changes.

This setup gives you a nice balance of having your ASCII art greeting and the flexibility to add more customizations as needed, all within the Oh My Fish framework.

Would you like me to explain how to create additional custom functions or themes with Oh My Fish? Or do you have any other specific customizations you'd like to add to this setup?

i think i may have not been as clear as i could have. my apologies. 

when i opened a terminal i was presented with what i think was probably something similar to fastfetch and it also displayed the colorscheme based on wal in that display. that's the ascii art display i was referring to. 

is that something represented here?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 21:36:14 UTC

 I apologize for the misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying. You're right, and I should have asked for more details earlier. What you're describing sounds indeed more like a system information display, similar to what tools like neofetch, fastfetch, or pfetch provide, rather than a simple ASCII art greeting.

Let's take a closer look at the files you provided:

<antThinking>The .zshrc file contains configuration details that might be relevant to setting up the system information display. While it doesn't directly contain the display code, it provides clues about where to look. This information could be useful for the user to reference, so I'll create an artifact to highlight the relevant parts.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="zshrc-config-loader" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="ML4W zshrc loader configuration">
# -----------------------------------------------------
# ML4W zshrc loader
# -----------------------------------------------------

# DON'T CHANGE THIS FILE

# You can define your custom configuration by adding
# files in ~/.config/zshrc 
# or by creating a folder ~/.config/zshrc/custom
# with you own zshrc configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------

if [ -d ~/.config/zshrc/custom ] ;then
    for f in ~/.config/zshrc/custom/*; do source $f; done
else
    for f in ~/.config/zshrc/*; do source $f; done
fi
</antArtifact>

Based on this configuration, the system information display you're looking for is likely set up in one of the files within `~/.config/zshrc/` or `~/.config/zshrc/custom/`.

Here's what we can deduce and what steps you can take:

1. The display you're referring to is probably set up using a tool like fastfetch, neofetch, or a custom script.

2. It's likely configured to use pywal for the color scheme, which explains why it displayed colors based on your wallpaper.

3. To find the exact configuration:
   - Check the contents of `~/.config/zshrc/` and `~/.config/zshrc/custom/` (if it exists).
   - Look for files that might contain fastfetch, neofetch, or similar commands.

4. Once you find the relevant configuration, you'll need to adapt it for fish shell.

Here's a general approach to set this up in fish:

1. Install fastfetch or neofetch if not already installed.

2. Edit your fish configuration file (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`) or create a new file in `~/.config/omf/before.init.fish` if you're using Oh My Fish.

3. Add a command to run the system information display. For example:

<antArtifact identifier="fish-fastfetch-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Fish configuration for fastfetch with pywal">
if status is-interactive
    # Run fastfetch with pywal colors
    if type -q fastfetch
        fastfetch
    end

    # If you want to use pywal colors, you might need something like:
    # cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences &
end
</antArtifact>

To get this working correctly:

1. Make sure fastfetch (or whichever tool you were using) is installed.
2. If you're using pywal, ensure it's set up correctly in your fish environment.
3. You might need to adjust the fastfetch configuration to match what you had in zsh.

Would you like me to help you search for the specific configuration in your zsh files? Or would you prefer guidance on setting up fastfetch (or a similar tool) from scratch in your fish configuration?

 Ah, thank you for providing this additional configuration. This gives us much more context about your setup. You're right, this configuration is very relevant to what we're looking for. Let's break it down and see how we can adapt it for your fish shell setup.

<antThinking>This zsh configuration is substantial and contains important details about the user's shell setup. It's a good candidate for an artifact as it provides valuable information for adapting the setup to fish.</antThinking>

</antArtifact>

Now, let's adapt this for your fish shell setup:

1. Oh My Posh: This is likely what's providing your prompt and potentially the system information display you were seeing. Oh My Posh is cross-shell compatible, so we can use it with fish as well.

2. To set up Oh My Posh in fish, edit your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file (or create it if it doesn't exist) and add:

<antArtifact identifier="fish-oh-my-posh-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Fish configuration with Oh My Posh">
if status is-interactive
    # Oh My Posh
    oh-my-posh init fish --config ~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml | source

    # FZF
    fzf_key_bindings

    # Set history file location
    set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
    set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
    set -gx SAVEHIST 10000
end
</antArtifact>

3. For the plugins you were using in zsh, you can find fish equivalents:
   - For git integration, fish has built-in git abbreviations and completions.
   - For syntax highlighting, you can use `fish_config` to enable it or install a plugin like `jorgebucaran/autopair.fish`.
   - For autosuggestions, fish has this feature built-in.

4. To install fish plugins, you can use a plugin manager like Oh My Fish or Fisher. For example, to install `jorgebucaran/autopair.fish` with Fisher:

   ```
   fisher install jorgebucaran/autopair.fish
   ```

5. The system information display you were seeing might have been part of your Oh My Posh theme. Check the `~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml` file to see if it includes any system information segments.

6. If the system info wasn't part of Oh My Posh, it might have been a separate command like neofetch or fastfetch. In that case, you can add it to your `config.fish`:

   ```fish
   if status is-interactive
       # Run fastfetch or neofetch
       if type -q fastfetch
           fastfetch
       else if type -q neofetch
           neofetch
       end
   end
   ```

To get everything set up:

1. Install Oh My Posh if you haven't already.
2. Copy your `zen.toml` theme file to `~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml` if it's not already there.
3. Update your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` with the provided configuration.
4. Install any additional fish plugins you want.
5. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

This should give you a setup in fish that's very similar to what you had in zsh, including the Oh My Posh prompt and potentially the system information display. If you're not seeing the system info display, let me know, and we can investigate further.

**Human** - 2024-09-03 21:48:57 UTC

as i don't have fisher installed, is the install syntax the same for omf?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 21:48:57 UTC

 You're right to ask, and I apologize for assuming you had Fisher installed. The syntax for Oh My Fish (OMF) is indeed different from Fisher. Let me provide you with the correct information for using Oh My Fish.

For Oh My Fish, the syntax to install a package is:

```
omf install [package_name]
```

However, it's important to note that Oh My Fish has its own repository of packages, which might not include all the packages available for Fisher. Let's adapt our approach for Oh My Fish:

1. To install packages with Oh My Fish, you would use:

   ```
   omf install [package_name]
   ```

2. For the specific plugins we mentioned earlier, you might want to check if they're available in the Oh My Fish repository. You can search for available packages using:

   ```
   omf search [keyword]
   ```

3. Some popular Oh My Fish packages that provide similar functionality to what you had in Zsh include:

   - `git` (for git integration, although fish has some built-in git features)
   - `bang-bang` (for bash-style `!!` and `!$` history substitutions)
   - `z` (for quick directory jumping)

4. To install these, you would use:

   ```
   omf install git
   omf install bang-bang
   omf install z
   ```

5. For syntax highlighting and autosuggestions, fish has these features built-in, so you don't need to install additional packages for them.

6. If you want to add a custom function or configuration, you can create a new file in `~/.config/omf/functions/` or modify `~/.config/omf/init.fish`.

Here's an updated version of the fish configuration, adapted for Oh My Fish:

<antArtifact identifier="omf-config-fish" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Oh My Fish configuration">
# ~/.config/omf/init.fish

# Oh My Posh
oh-my-posh init fish --config ~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml | source

# Set history file location
set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
set -gx SAVEHIST 10000

# Run fastfetch or neofetch if available
if type -q fastfetch
    fastfetch
else if type -q neofetch
    neofetch
end

# You can add more custom configurations here

# Load any custom functions
if test -d $HOME/.config/omf/functions
    for f in $HOME/.config/omf/functions/*.fish
        source $f
    end
end
</antArtifact>

To set this up:

1. Make sure Oh My Fish is installed.
2. Create or edit the file `~/.config/omf/init.fish` with the content above.
3. Install any Oh My Fish packages you want using `omf install [package_name]`.
4. Restart your terminal or run `omf reload`.

This setup should give you a configuration similar to what you had in Zsh, adapted for fish and Oh My Fish. If you're looking for any specific functionality that you had in Zsh and can't find an equivalent in Oh My Fish, please let me know, and I'll help you find a solution or create a custom function to replicate it.

**Human** - 2024-09-03 21:51:14 UTC

did you see mention of a flashfetch anywhere in these configs i've shared?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 21:51:14 UTC

 I apologize for the oversight. You're right to ask, and I should have been more thorough in my review. Let me take another careful look at the configurations you've shared.

<antThinking>After re-examining the provided configurations, I realize there's no explicit mention of fastfetch or any similar system information display tool. This is an important detail I missed earlier, and it's crucial for addressing the user's original question about the ASCII art display.</antThinking>

Upon careful review of the configurations you've shared, including the .zshrc file and the additional customization snippet, I can confirm that there is no explicit mention of fastfetch, neofetch, or any similar system information display tool in these configs.

The configurations we've seen mainly focus on:
1. Oh-My-Zsh setup and plugins
2. FZF (fuzzy finder) configuration
3. History settings
4. Oh-My-Posh prompt setup

The ASCII art display you remember seeing when you opened the terminal is not directly referenced in these configurations. This suggests a few possibilities:

1. The display might have been part of the Oh-My-Posh theme you were using (`zen.toml`).
2. It could have been set up in a separate file that was sourced by your zsh configuration.
3. It might have been part of a system-wide configuration not present in your user-specific files.

To track down where this display was coming from, we could take a few steps:

1. Check the contents of your Oh-My-Posh theme file: `~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml`
2. Look for any additional files in `~/.config/zshrc/` or `~/.config/zshrc/custom/` that might contain the setup for this display.
3. Check your system's global zsh configuration files (like `/etc/zsh/zshrc` or similar) for any system-wide setups.

Would you like me to guide you through checking these locations? Or, if you prefer, we could set up a similar display in your fish configuration using a tool like neofetch or fastfetch, even if it wasn't explicitly in your zsh setup.

 Ah, excellent find! Thank you for locating and sharing that. You're absolutely right, and I apologize for missing this earlier. Let's break down this configuration and then adapt it for your fish shell setup.

<antThinking>This autostart configuration is crucial for recreating the user's desired terminal experience. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be modified, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="zsh-autostart-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Zsh Autostart Configuration">
# -----------------------------------------------------
# AUTOSTART
# -----------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Fastfetch
# -----------------------------------------------------
if [[ $(tty) == *"pts"* ]]; then
    fastfetch --config examples/13
else
    echo
    if [ -f /bin/qtile ]; then
        echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
    fi
    if [ -f /bin/hyprctl ]; then
        echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
    fi
fi
</antArtifact>

Now, let's adapt this for your fish shell configuration. We'll create a new file or modify your existing `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file:

<antArtifact identifier="fish-autostart-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Fish Autostart Configuration">
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

if status is-interactive
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # AUTOSTART
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Pywal
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences

    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Fastfetch
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    if string match -q "*pts*" (tty)
        fastfetch --config examples/13
    else
        echo
        if test -f /bin/qtile
            echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
        end
        if test -f /bin/hyprctl
            echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
        end
    end

    # Add any other configurations or function calls here
end
</antArtifact>

Here's what this configuration does:

1. It loads the Pywal color sequences, which sets your terminal colors based on your wallpaper.
2. It runs Fastfetch with a specific configuration (`examples/13`) if you're in a pseudo-terminal session (like most terminal emulators).
3. If you're not in a pseudo-terminal (like a TTY), it provides instructions for starting Qtile or Hyprland, depending on which is installed.

To set this up:

1. Open or create the file `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
2. Copy the content from the "Fish Autostart Configuration" artifact into this file.
3. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`

Make sure you have Fastfetch and Pywal installed on your system for this to work correctly. If you're using Oh My Fish, you might want to put this configuration in `~/.config/omf/init.fish` instead.

This setup should give you the same experience you had with zsh: your terminal colors will be set by Pywal, and you'll see the Fastfetch display when you open a new terminal window.

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or add to this configuration?

**Human** - 2024-09-03 21:56:48 UTC

one last thing, my previous fish config had a sort of stylized prompt (it looked sort of like a fish) i have to imagine omf has themes as would oh-my-zsh or -bash?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 21:56:48 UTC

 You're absolutely right! Oh My Fish (OMF) does indeed have themes, similar to Oh My Zsh or Oh My Bash. These themes can customize your prompt, including creating stylized designs like the fish-shaped prompt you mentioned. Let's explore how to set up and use themes in Oh My Fish.

<antThinking>Information about Oh My Fish themes and how to use them would be valuable for the user to reference later. This is a good candidate for an artifact as it's substantial and likely to be used multiple times.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="omf-themes-info" type="text/markdown" title="Oh My Fish Themes Guide">
# Oh My Fish Themes

Oh My Fish comes with a variety of built-in themes that you can use to customize your prompt. Here's how to work with OMF themes:

1. List available themes:
   ```
   omf theme
   ```

2. Preview a theme:
   ```
   omf theme <theme_name>
   ```

3. Apply a theme:
   ```
   omf theme <theme_name>
   ```

4. Some popular themes that might give you a stylized prompt:
   - `bobthefish`: A powerline-style, informative prompt
   - `agnoster`: Another powerline-style theme
   - `cmorrell`: A theme with a stylized prompt
   - `clearance`: A clean, informative prompt
   - `shellder`: A minimal, sleek theme

5. To revert to the default theme:
   ```
   omf theme default
   ```

6. You can also install additional themes from the OMF repository:
   ```
   omf install <theme_name>
   ```

Remember, you can always create your own custom theme if you can't find one that matches your preferences exactly.
</antArtifact>

To set up a theme in Oh My Fish:

1. First, list the available themes:
   ```
   omf theme
   ```

2. If you see a theme you like, you can apply it directly:
   ```
   omf theme <theme_name>
   ```
   For example, if you want to try the "bobthefish" theme, which has a stylized prompt:
   ```
   omf theme bobthefish
   ```

3. If you don't see a theme you like, you can install additional themes. For example:
   ```
   omf install bobthefish
   omf theme bobthefish
   ```

4. If you're looking for something specifically fish-shaped, you might need to explore custom themes or create your own. The "fishface" theme, if available, might be close to what you're looking for.

5. To preview themes without applying them permanently, you can use:
   ```
   fish_config
   ```
   This will open a web interface where you can browse and preview various prompts.

If you can't find a theme that matches your previous fish-shaped prompt exactly, you might need to create a custom theme or modify an existing one. Would you like guidance on how to create or modify a theme to get your desired fish-shaped prompt?

Remember, after changing your theme, you may need to restart your terminal or run `omf reload` to see the changes take effect.

**Human** - 2024-09-03 21:58:13 UTC

will i then be keeping any of the previous config.fish ?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 21:58:13 UTC

 You raise an excellent point. We want to make sure we're not losing any important configurations while setting up your new theme. Let's review and combine the configurations.

<antThinking>We need to merge the previous config.fish content with the new theme setup. This combined configuration is substantial and likely to be modified, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

Here's how we can approach this:

1. We'll keep the autostart configuration we set up earlier.
2. We'll add the Oh My Fish theme configuration.
3. We'll make sure any other important settings from your previous config.fish are preserved.

Let's create a new, combined config.fish:

<antArtifact identifier="combined-fish-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Combined Fish Configuration">
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

if status is-interactive
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # AUTOSTART
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Pywal
    cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences

    # Fastfetch
    if string match -q "*pts*" (tty)
        fastfetch --config examples/13
    else
        echo
        if test -f /bin/qtile
            echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
        end
        if test -f /bin/hyprctl
            echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
        end
    end

    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Oh My Fish Theme
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # You can replace 'bobthefish' with your preferred theme
    omf theme bobthefish

    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Additional configurations from previous config.fish
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Add any other configurations or function calls here
    # For example:
    # set -gx PATH $HOME/bin $PATH
    # alias ll='ls -lah'
    
    # If you were using Oh My Posh before, you might want to keep that configuration:
    # oh-my-posh init fish --config ~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml | source

    # Set history file location (if you want to keep this from the previous setup)
    set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
    set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
    set -gx SAVEHIST 10000
end
</antArtifact>

To implement this:

1. Open your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file in a text editor.
2. Replace the contents with the configuration from the artifact above.
3. Review each section and make sure it aligns with your preferences:
   - The AUTOSTART section keeps your Pywal and Fastfetch setup.
   - The Oh My Fish Theme section is where you set your chosen theme.
   - The Additional configurations section is where you can add any other settings or functions you had in your previous config.fish.

4. If you're using Oh My Posh, uncomment the Oh My Posh initialization line and comment out or remove the `omf theme` line.

5. Add any other aliases, functions, or environment variables you were using before.

6. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

This combined configuration preserves your autostart features (Pywal and Fastfetch), sets up your Oh My Fish theme, and leaves room for any additional configurations you might have had.

Remember, if you're using Oh My Fish, some configurations might be better placed in `~/.config/omf/init.fish` or as separate function files in `~/.config/omf/functions/`. If you have a lot of custom functions or complex configurations, we can discuss organizing them in a more modular way.

Is there anything specific from your previous config.fish that you want to make sure we include?

**Human** - 2024-09-03 21:59:40 UTC

we've now doubled up on our fetches.. where did we have that in there initially?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 21:59:40 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that oversight. Thank you for catching that. Let's correct this duplication and streamline our configuration.

The fetch (fastfetch in this case) was initially part of the autostart section we brought over from your zsh configuration. We don't need to run it twice, so let's clean this up.

Here's a revised, streamlined version of the config.fish:

<antThinking>We need to correct the duplication of the fastfetch command and ensure the configuration is clean and efficient. This revised configuration is substantial and represents an important update, making it a good candidate for a new artifact.</antThinking>

        fastfetch --config examples/13
    else
        echo
        if test -f /bin/qtile
            echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
        end
        if test -f /bin/hyprctl
            echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
        end
    end

    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Oh My Fish Theme
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # You can replace 'bobthefish' with your preferred theme
    # Comment this out if you're using Oh My Posh

    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Uncomment the line below if you're using Oh My Posh
    # oh-my-posh init fish --config ~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml | source

    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Additional configurations
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # Add any other configurations or function calls here
    # For example:
    # set -gx PATH $HOME/bin $PATH

    # Set history file location
    set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
    set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
    set -gx SAVEHIST 10000
end
</antArtifact>

To implement this:

1. Open your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file in a text editor.
2. Replace the entire contents with the configuration from the artifact above.
3. Choose between using Oh My Fish themes or Oh My Posh:
   - If you're using Oh My Fish themes, keep the `omf theme bobthefish` line (or replace 'bobthefish' with your preferred theme).
   - If you're using Oh My Posh, comment out the `omf theme` line and uncomment the `oh-my-posh init` line.
4. Add any additional configurations, aliases, or functions you need at the bottom of the file.
5. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

This configuration now:
- Runs Pywal to set your terminal colors.
- Runs Fastfetch once, only in pseudo-terminal sessions.
- Sets up either an Oh My Fish theme or Oh My Posh, depending on your preference.
- Includes your history settings.
- Provides space for any additional configurations you might need.

Is this more in line with what you were expecting? Do you have any other specific configurations or functions from your previous setup that you'd like to include?

---

**Human** - 2024-09-03 22:02:11 UTC

nope, it's the init.fish that we put in ~/.config/omf/ that's the culprit. it seems like it's basically the same file, no?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 22:02:11 UTC

 You're absolutely correct, and I apologize for missing that crucial detail. You're right that we've essentially created duplicate configurations between `~/.config/fish/config.fish` and `~/.config/omf/init.fish`. This is an important observation, and we should definitely address it.

Let's clarify the roles of these files and consolidate our configuration:

1. `~/.config/fish/config.fish` is the main configuration file for Fish shell.
2. `~/.config/omf/init.fish` is specific to Oh My Fish and is loaded after the main config.fish.

Since you're using Oh My Fish, it makes more sense to keep most of our custom configuration in the `init.fish` file. Here's how we can reorganize things:

<antThinking>We need to consolidate the configuration into the Oh My Fish init.fish file, removing duplications and ensuring a clean, efficient setup. This consolidated configuration is substantial and represents an important update, making it a good candidate for a new artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="consolidated-omf-init" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Consolidated Oh My Fish init.fish">
# ~/.config/omf/init.fish

# -----------------------------------------------------
# AUTOSTART
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Pywal
cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences

# Fastfetch
if status is-interactive
    if string match -q "*pts*" (tty)
        fastfetch --config examples/13
    else
        echo
        if test -f /bin/qtile
            echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
        end
        if test -f /bin/hyprctl
            echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
        end
    end
end

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Oh My Fish Theme
# -----------------------------------------------------
# You can replace 'bobthefish' with your preferred theme
# Comment this out if you're using Oh My Posh
omf theme bobthefish

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Oh My Posh (if you prefer this over Oh My Fish themes)
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Uncomment the line below if you're using Oh My Posh
# oh-my-posh init fish --config ~/.config/ohmyposh/zen.toml | source

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Additional configurations
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Add any other configurations or function calls here
# For example:
# set -gx PATH $HOME/bin $PATH
# alias ll='ls -lah'

# Set history file location
set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
set -gx SAVEHIST 10000
</antArtifact>

Now, for your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, we can keep it minimal:

<antArtifact identifier="minimal-config-fish" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Minimal config.fish">
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# Any system-wide configurations can go here
# Most custom configurations should go in ~/.config/omf/init.fish
</antArtifact>

To implement this:

1. Replace the contents of `~/.config/omf/init.fish` with the configuration from the "Consolidated Oh My Fish init.fish" artifact.
2. Replace the contents of `~/.config/fish/config.fish` with the minimal configuration from the "Minimal config.fish" artifact.
3. Review the `init.fish` file and make sure all the configurations you need are there.
4. Choose between Oh My Fish themes and Oh My Posh by commenting/uncommenting the appropriate lines.
5. Add any additional configurations you need at the bottom of the `init.fish` file.
6. Save both files and restart your terminal or run `omf reload`.

This setup should:
- Eliminate duplication between `config.fish` and `init.fish`
- Keep most of your custom configuration in the Oh My Fish `init.fish` file
- Run Pywal and Fastfetch as part of your Oh My Fish initialization
- Set up your chosen theme (either Oh My Fish theme or Oh My Posh)
- Include your history settings and leave room for additional configurations

Does this consolidated setup look better to you? Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or add?

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 22:19:27 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the oversight. This error suggests that there's an issue with the `fish_prompt` function, likely caused by a compatibility problem between the shell commands used in the prompt and Fish's syntax. Let's address this issue.

The error is occurring because the `hostname` command is not being recognized. In Fish, we need to use the `command` builtin to run external commands like `hostname`. Additionally, we should use Fish's string manipulation functions instead of `cut` for better compatibility.

Let's fix the `fish_prompt` function:

<antThinking>We need to correct the fish_prompt function to use Fish-compatible syntax. This is an important part of the shell configuration and warrants its own artifact for easy reference and modification.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="corrected-fish-prompt" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Corrected fish_prompt function">
# ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish

function fish_prompt
    set -l host (string split '.' -- (command hostname))[1]
    set -l cwd (basename (prompt_pwd))
    
    echo -n (set_color --bold yellow)$USER(set_color normal)
    echo -n '@'
    echo -n (set_color --bold red)$host(set_color normal)
    echo -n ':'
    echo -n (set_color --bold blue)$cwd(set_color normal)
    echo -n '> '
end
</antArtifact>

To implement this fix:

1. Open or create the file `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` in a text editor.
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish`.

This corrected `fish_prompt` function:
- Uses `command hostname` to ensure we're calling the external `hostname` command.
- Uses Fish's `string split` function instead of `cut` to get the first part of the hostname.
- Uses Fish's native color setting syntax.

If you're using Oh My Fish with a theme, this `fish_prompt` function might be overridden by the theme's own prompt function. In that case, you might want to modify the theme's prompt function directly or choose a different theme.

To check if a theme is overriding your prompt, you can run:

```fish
functions fish_prompt
```

If it shows the function we just created, then it's being used. If it shows a different function, then a theme is likely overriding it.

In that case, you have a few options:
1. Stick with the theme's prompt if you like it.
2. Modify the theme's prompt function to your liking.
3. Choose a different theme or no theme at all to use your custom prompt.

Would you like to keep this custom prompt, or would you prefer to use a theme's prompt? Also, are there any other error messages or unexpected behaviors you're seeing that we should address?

 I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're absolutely right, and thank you for sharing the existing `fish_prompt` function. This is indeed a more comprehensive and customized prompt than what I initially suggested. Let's analyze this function and see if we can resolve the error you're encountering while maintaining its functionality.

The error you're seeing is likely due to the `hostname` command. In Fish, it's generally better to use the `command` builtin for external commands to ensure compatibility. Let's modify your existing function to address this and make a few other small improvements:

Key changes made:

1. Replace `hostname | cut -d . -f 1` with `command hostname | string split -f1 '.'`. This uses the `command` builtin and Fish's `string` function instead of `cut`.
2. Replace the `sed` command with Fish's `string replace` function for replacing the home directory with `~`.
3. Fixed a typo in the git prompt settings (changed `stagedstate` to `untrackedfiles` for the `…` symbol).
4. Used `test` instead of `[` for the root user check, which is more idiomatic in Fish.

To implement this:

1. Open the file `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` in a text editor.
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish`.

This updated function should resolve the "Unknown command: hostname" error while maintaining the functionality and style of your original prompt.

Is there anything else about this prompt that you'd like to modify or any other issues you're experiencing?

 You're right to seek confirmation, and I apologize if I wasn't clear earlier. Let's review the situation and make sure we have everything properly consolidated and error-free.

This merged configuration is substantial and represents the final setup, making it an ideal candidate for a comprehensive artifact.</antThinking>

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Additional configurations
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Set history file location
set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
set -gx SAVEHIST 10000

# Add any other configurations or function calls here
# For example:
# set -gx PATH $HOME/bin $PATH
# alias ll='ls -lah'
</antArtifact>

To implement this consolidated setup:

1. Open the file `~/.config/omf/init.fish` in a text editor.
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file.
4. You can now remove or empty the `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` file, as the function is now defined in the Oh My Fish init file.
5. Make sure your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file is minimal and doesn't contain any duplicate configurations.
6. Restart your terminal or run `omf reload` to apply the changes.

This consolidated configuration:
- Runs the autostart features (Pywal and Fastfetch)
- Defines your custom `fish_prompt` function with the fixes we discussed
- Sets up your history preferences
- Provides space for any additional configurations you might need

By putting everything in the `init.fish` file, we ensure that Oh My Fish loads all these settings correctly, and we avoid potential conflicts or duplications between different configuration files.

This setup should resolve the "Unknown command: hostname" error and provide a clean, consolidated configuration for your Fish shell with Oh My Fish.

Is this what you were looking for? Do you want to test it out and see if it resolves the issues you were experiencing?

this merges the two configs and settles the error? hopefully..

---

**Human** - 2024-09-03 22:22:33 UTC

sorry, i misspoke this time.. by "the two configs" i meant our respective copies of fish_prompt.fish

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 22:22:33 UTC

 I apologize for the misunderstanding, and thank you for clarifying. You're absolutely right - we should focus on merging our respective versions of the `fish_prompt.fish` file. Let's combine the best parts of both to create a unified, error-free version.

<antThinking>We need to merge the two versions of fish_prompt.fish, incorporating the fixes for the hostname error while preserving the functionality and style of the original prompt. This merged function is substantial and represents an important update, making it a good candidate for a new artifact.</antThinking>

Here's the merged version of `fish_prompt.fish` that combines your original styling with the fixes we discussed:

<antArtifact identifier="merged-fish-prompt" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Merged fish_prompt function">
# ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish

function fish_prompt
    set user (set_color --bold cyan)(whoami)(set_color normal)
    set machine (set_color --bold blue)(command hostname | string split -f1 '.')(set_color normal)
    set -l realhome ~
    set directory (set_color --bold green)(string replace -r "^$realhome" "~" $PWD)(set_color normal)
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_show_informative_status 'yes'
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_showcolorhints 'yes'
    set color_bold_red (set_color --bold red)
    set color_bold_yellow (set_color --bold yellow)
    set color_bold_cyan (set_color --bold cyan)
    set color_reset (set_color normal)
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_dirtystate "$color_bold_red±$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_cleanstate "$color_bold_red♥$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_stagedstate "$color_bold_yellow●$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_untrackedfiles "$color_bold_cyan…$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_stateseparator ' '
    # I have *no* idea why this works. Maybe set_color just ignores the second bold?
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_color_branch "--bold" "--bold" "yellow"
    set color_bold_magenta (set_color --bold magenta)
    set git (__fish_git_prompt "$color_bold_magenta^$color_reset%s")
    echo -s $user (set_color yellow)'@' $machine ':' $directory $git
    if test "$USER" = "root"
        set caret (set_color red)"#"
    else
        set caret (set_color magenta)"\$"
    end
    echo -s $caret ' '(set_color normal)
end
</antArtifact>

Key changes in this merged version:

1. Used `command hostname | string split -f1 '.'` instead of `hostname | cut -d . -f 1` to fix the hostname error.
2. Replaced `echo $PWD | sed -e "s|^$realhome|~|"` with `string replace -r "^$realhome" "~" $PWD` for better Fish shell compatibility.
3. Changed `[` to `test` in the root user check, which is more idiomatic in Fish.
4. Kept all your original color settings and git prompt configurations.

To implement this:

1. Open the file `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` in a text editor.
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file.
4. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` to apply the changes.

This merged version should resolve the "Unknown command: hostname" error while maintaining the look and functionality of your original prompt. It keeps all the git status indicators and color settings you had before.

Does this merged version look good to you? Would you like to test it and see if it resolves the issues you were experiencing with the prompt?

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 22:24:13 UTC

 You're right, this error does look different, and it's good that you noticed. I apologize for the continued issue. It seems that the `hostname` command is still not being recognized, even with the `command` builtin. Let's try a different approach using Fish's built-in functions.

<antThinking>We need to revise the fish_prompt function again, this time avoiding the use of external commands entirely. We'll use Fish's built-in functions to achieve the same result. This revised function is an important update and warrants a new artifact.</antThinking>

Here's a revised version of the `fish_prompt` function that should work without relying on external commands:

<antArtifact identifier="revised-fish-prompt" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Revised fish_prompt function">
# ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish

function fish_prompt
    set user (set_color --bold cyan)$USER(set_color normal)
    set machine (set_color --bold blue)(string split -f1 '.' -- $hostname)(set_color normal)
    set -l realhome ~
    set directory (set_color --bold green)(string replace -r "^$realhome" "~" $PWD)(set_color normal)
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_show_informative_status 'yes'
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_showcolorhints 'yes'
    set color_bold_red (set_color --bold red)
    set color_bold_yellow (set_color --bold yellow)
    set color_bold_cyan (set_color --bold cyan)
    set color_reset (set_color normal)
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_dirtystate "$color_bold_red±$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_cleanstate "$color_bold_red♥$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_stagedstate "$color_bold_yellow●$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_untrackedfiles "$color_bold_cyan…$color_reset"
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_char_stateseparator ' '
    # I have *no* idea why this works. Maybe set_color just ignores the second bold?
    set -g __fish_git_prompt_color_branch "--bold" "--bold" "yellow"
    set color_bold_magenta (set_color --bold magenta)
    set git (__fish_git_prompt "$color_bold_magenta^$color_reset%s")
    echo -s $user (set_color yellow)'@' $machine ':' $directory $git
    if test "$USER" = "root"
        set caret (set_color red)"#"
    else
        set caret (set_color magenta)"\$"
    end
    echo -s $caret ' '(set_color normal)
end
</antArtifact>

Key changes in this revised version:

1. Replaced `(whoami)` with `$USER`, which is a built-in variable in Fish.
2. Changed `(command hostname | string split -f1 '.')` to `(string split -f1 '.' -- $hostname)`. Fish has a built-in `$hostname` variable that we can use instead of calling the external `hostname` command.
3. Kept all other parts of your prompt intact, including colors and git status indicators.

To implement this:

1. Open the file `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` in a text editor.
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file.
4. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` to apply the changes.

This version should work without any "Unknown command" errors because it doesn't rely on any external commands. It uses Fish's built-in variables and functions to achieve the same result.

Could you please try this version and let me know if it resolves the issue? If you're still seeing any errors or if the prompt doesn't look right, please share the exact output or error message you're seeing.

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 22:28:22 UTC

 Thank you for running `omf doctor` and sharing the output. You're right, we're very close! The issue we're encountering now is due to a conflict between the custom `fish_prompt.fish` file we created and Oh My Fish's theme system. Let's resolve this.

The warning message suggests that we should remove the `fish_prompt.fish` file to allow Oh My Fish to manage the prompt through its theme system. Here's what we should do:

1. First, let's backup your current `fish_prompt.fish` file:

   ```
   mv ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish.backup
   ```

2. Now, remove the original file as suggested by `omf doctor`:

   ```
   rm ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
   ```

3. If you want to keep your custom prompt, we should integrate it with Oh My Fish's theme system. To do this, we can create a custom theme. Let's call it "blake-custom":

   ```
   omf new theme blake-custom
   ```

4. This will create a new theme directory. Edit the main theme file:

   ```
   nano ~/.local/share/omf/themes/blake-custom/functions/fish_prompt.fish
   ```

5. Copy the contents of your backed-up `fish_prompt.fish` into this new file and save it.

6. Activate your new custom theme:

   ```
   omf theme blake-custom
   ```

Here's a summary of these steps in an easily copyable format:

<antArtifact identifier="omf-custom-theme-setup" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Oh My Fish Custom Theme Setup">
# Backup existing fish_prompt.fish
mv ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish.backup

# Remove the original file
rm ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish

# Create a new custom theme
omf new theme blake-custom

# Edit the new theme's fish_prompt.fish file
# (You'll need to manually copy your custom prompt code into this file)
nano ~/.local/share/omf/themes/blake-custom/functions/fish_prompt.fish

# Activate the new custom theme
omf theme blake-custom

# Reload Oh My Fish
omf reload
</antArtifact>

After following these steps, run `omf doctor` again. The warning about the overridden `fish_prompt.fish` should be gone, and you should have your custom prompt working within the Oh My Fish framework.

If you encounter any issues or if the prompt doesn't look right after these changes, please let me know, and we can make further adjustments.

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:11:12 UTC

i know this is getting long... i ditched omf in favor of starship and now i need to figure out how to integrate that init.fish

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:11:12 UTC

 I appreciate your patience, and thank you for updating me on your decision to switch to Starship. That's a great choice for a customizable and fast prompt. Let's integrate Starship into your Fish configuration.

First, let's review what we need to do:

1. Remove Oh My Fish (OMF) configuration
2. Set up Starship
3. Integrate the contents of your `init.fish` file

Here's how we can do this:

1. Remove Oh My Fish:
   If you haven't already, you can uninstall OMF with:
   ```
   omf destroy
   ```

2. Set up Starship:
   If you haven't installed Starship yet, you can do so following the instructions on their website. Once installed, you need to add the initialization to your Fish config.

3. Integrate your `init.fish` content:
   We'll merge the necessary parts of your `init.fish` with the Starship initialization in your `config.fish`.

Let's create a new `config.fish` that incorporates everything:

<antArtifact identifier="integrated-fish-starship-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Integrated Fish Configuration with Starship">
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# -----------------------------------------------------
# AUTOSTART
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Pywal
if test -f ~/.cache/wal/sequences
    cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences
end

# Fastfetch
if status is-interactive
    if string match -q "*pts*" (tty)
        if type -q fastfetch
            fastfetch --config examples/13
        end
    else
        echo
        if test -f /bin/qtile
            echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
        end
        if test -f /bin/hyprctl
            echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
        end
    end
end

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Additional configurations
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Set history file location
set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
set -gx SAVEHIST 10000

# Add any other configurations or function calls here
# For example:
# set -gx PATH $HOME/bin $PATH
# alias ll='ls -lah'

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Starship Prompt
# -----------------------------------------------------
if type -q starship
    starship init fish | source
end
</antArtifact>

To implement this:

1. Open or create the file `~/.config/fish/config.fish` in a text editor.
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file.
4. If you have any custom functions, you can keep them in separate files in the `~/.config/fish/functions/` directory.

This configuration:
- Runs the autostart features (Pywal and Fastfetch) that were in your original `init.fish`
- Sets up your history preferences
- Initializes Starship if it's installed
- Provides space for any additional configurations you might need

Additionally, you might want to customize Starship. You can do this by creating or editing `~/.config/starship.toml`. Here's a basic example to get you started:

<antArtifact identifier="basic-starship-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="toml" title="Basic Starship Configuration">
# ~/.config/starship.toml

# Get editor completions based on the config schema
"$schema" = 'https://starship.rs/config-schema.json'

# Inserts a blank line between shell prompts
add_newline = true

# Replace the '❯' symbol in the prompt with '➜'
[character] # The name of the module we are configuring is 'character'
success_symbol = '[➜](bold green)' # The 'success_symbol' segment is being set to '➜' with the color 'bold green'

# Disable the package module, hiding it from the prompt completely
[package]
disabled = true
</antArtifact>

You can customize this further based on your preferences. The Starship documentation has many more options you can explore.

After making these changes:
1. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish` to apply the changes.
2. If you created a Starship config, you might need to restart your terminal for it to take effect.

Does this setup align with what you were looking for? Would you like to make any adjustments or add any specific features to your Fish and Starship configuration?

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:13:42 UTC

 Thank you for sharing your `starship.toml` file. This is a well-configured Starship prompt with custom symbols for various programming languages, tools, and environments. Let's integrate this with your Fish shell configuration.

<antThinking>The provided starship.toml is substantial and contains important customizations. We should keep this configuration and ensure it's properly referenced in the Fish setup. This warrants updating our previous Fish configuration artifact.</antThinking>

Here's how we can update your Fish configuration to work with this Starship setup:

<antArtifact identifier="updated-fish-starship-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="fish" title="Updated Fish Configuration with Starship">
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# -----------------------------------------------------
# AUTOSTART
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Pywal
if test -f ~/.cache/wal/sequences
    cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences
end

# Fastfetch
if status is-interactive
    if string match -q "*pts*" (tty)
        if type -q fastfetch
            fastfetch --config examples/13
        end
    else
        echo
        if test -f /bin/qtile
            echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
        end
        if test -f /bin/hyprctl
            echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
        end
    end
end

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Additional configurations
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Set history file location
set -gx HISTFILE ~/.fish_history
set -gx HISTSIZE 10000
set -gx SAVEHIST 10000

# Add any other configurations or function calls here
# For example:
# set -gx PATH $HOME/bin $PATH
# alias ll='ls -lah'

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Starship Prompt
# -----------------------------------------------------
if type -q starship
    starship init fish | source
end

# Ensure Starship uses the correct config file
set -gx STARSHIP_CONFIG ~/.config/starship.toml
</antArtifact>

To implement this:

1. Ensure your `starship.toml` file is located at `~/.config/starship.toml`. If it's not there already, move it:
   ```
   mv /path/to/your/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```

2. Open or create the file `~/.config/fish/config.fish` in a text editor.
3. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
4. Save the file.

This configuration:
- Keeps the autostart features (Pywal and Fastfetch) from your original setup
- Maintains your history preferences
- Initializes Starship and explicitly sets the path to your custom configuration file

The last line `set -gx STARSHIP_CONFIG ~/.config/starship.toml` ensures that Starship uses your custom configuration file, which includes all the symbol customizations you've set up.

After making these changes:
1. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish` to apply the changes.

Your prompt should now reflect the customizations in your `starship.toml` file, including the custom symbols for various programming languages and environments.

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust in this setup? Do you want to add any Fish-specific features or aliases that aren't covered by the Starship configuration?

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:15:43 UTC

except we didn't customize the starship.toml or if we did, i missed it.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:15:43 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely right, and thank you for pointing that out. We didn't customize the `starship.toml` file; you provided the one that shipped with the install. Let's address this and see if you want to make any changes to it.

The `starship.toml` file you shared is already quite comprehensive and includes a lot of custom symbols for various programming languages, tools, and environments. If you're happy with this configuration, we don't need to make any changes to it.

However, if you'd like to customize it further, we can do that. Here are some common customizations people often make:

1. Changing the order of prompt elements
2. Adjusting colors
3. Adding or removing information from the prompt

<antThinking>The user might want to customize their Starship prompt further. Providing a few examples of common customizations could be helpful. This information is substantial and likely to be referenced later, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="starship-customization-examples" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="toml" title="Starship Customization Examples">
# ~/.config/starship.toml

# Example 1: Changing the order of prompt elements
format = """
$username\
$hostname\
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$cmd_duration\
$line_break\
$python\
$character"""

# Example 2: Adjusting colors
[character]
success_symbol = "[➜](bold green)"
error_symbol = "[✗](bold red)"

[directory]
style = "blue bold"

[git_branch]
format = "[$branch]($style)"
style = "bright-black"

# Example 3: Adding more information to the prompt
[battery]
full_symbol = "🔋"
charging_symbol = "🔌"
discharging_symbol = "⚡"

[[battery.display]]
threshold = 30
style = "bold red"

[time]
disabled = false
format = '🕙[\[ $time \]]($style) '
time_format = "%T"
</antArtifact>

These are just examples. You can add these to your existing `starship.toml` file or replace sections as you see fit. 

To customize your Starship prompt:

1. Open your `starship.toml` file:
   ```
   nano ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```

2. Make any changes you want. You can use the examples above for inspiration, or check the [Starship documentation](https://starship.rs/config/) for more options.

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Restart your terminal or run `starship init fish | source` to see the changes.

Remember, the `starship.toml` file you provided is already well-configured. If you're happy with how your prompt looks and functions, you don't need to make any changes.

Would you like to make any specific changes to your Starship configuration? Or are you satisfied with the current setup?

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:16:20 UTC

that seems pretty light compared to the one i already have..

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:16:20 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not recognizing that earlier. The `starship.toml` file you provided is indeed much more comprehensive and detailed than the examples I gave. Let's take a closer look at your configuration and discuss how we might enhance it further if needed.

<antThinking>The user's existing starship.toml is extensive and well-configured. We should analyze it and suggest potential enhancements that align with its current level of detail. This analysis would be substantial and useful for reference, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="starship-config-analysis" type="text/markdown" title="Analysis of Current Starship Configuration">
# Analysis of Current Starship Configuration

Your current `starship.toml` is very detailed and customized. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1. Custom symbols for various programming languages and tools (e.g., C, Python, Rust, Docker).
2. Git status symbols for ahead, behind, diverged, renamed, and deleted states.
3. Custom OS symbols for different Linux distributions and other operating systems.
4. Tailored symbols for cloud platforms (AWS) and package managers.
5. Specific configurations for version control systems (Git, Mercurial).

Potential Enhancements:

1. Prompt Structure: You could define a custom `format` to control the order and presence of elements in your prompt.

2. Styling: While you have custom symbols, you might want to add color styling to various elements.

3. Conditional Formatting: You could add conditions to show/hide certain elements based on context.

4. Command Duration: You might want to show how long commands take to execute.

5. Time in Prompt: Adding a timestamp to your prompt could be useful.

6. Battery Status: If you're on a laptop, showing battery status could be helpful.
</antArtifact>

Based on this analysis, here are some potential enhancements you might consider:

1. Define a custom prompt structure:

```toml
format = """
$username\
$hostname\
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$python\
$rust\
$nodejs\
$docker_context\
$time\
$line_break\
$character"""
```

2. Add some color styling:

```toml
[directory]
style = "blue bold"

[git_branch]
style = "green"

[git_status]
style = "red"
```

3. Show command duration for long-running commands:

```toml
[cmd_duration]
min_time = 500
format = "took [$duration](bold yellow)"
```

4. Add a timestamp to your prompt:

```toml
[time]
disabled = false
format = '[$time](bold blue) '
time_format = "%H:%M:%S"
```

5. If you use a laptop, you might want to add battery status:

```toml
[battery]
full_symbol = "🔋"
charging_symbol = "🔌"
discharging_symbol = "⚡"

[[battery.display]]
threshold = 30
style = "bold red"
```

To implement any of these:

1. Open your `~/.config/starship.toml` file in a text editor.
2. Add the sections you're interested in.
3. Save the file and restart your terminal or run `starship init fish | source`.

Remember, these are just suggestions. Your current configuration is already very comprehensive, so you might not need all or any of these additions. It really depends on your personal preferences and workflow needs.

Would you like to implement any of these changes, or do you have any specific aspects of your prompt you'd like to modify?

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:17:02 UTC

well, i figured we would merge the two, right?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:17:02 UTC

 You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not suggesting that immediately. Merging the two configurations is indeed the best approach. Let's combine your existing comprehensive configuration with some of the additional features we discussed.

<antThinking>We need to merge the user's existing starship.toml with the suggested enhancements. This merged configuration will be substantial and represent the final setup, making it an ideal candidate for a comprehensive artifact.</antThinking>

 Certainly! I appreciate you providing that information about using `(echo $hostname)`. Let's modify the configuration to meet your specific requirements. We'll remove the time, add back the stylized fish symbol, and include the user@hostname in the format you specified.

</antArtifact>

Here are the key changes made:

1. Removed the `$time` element from the format string.
2. Modified the `[character]` section to use a stylized fish symbol (`><>`).
3. Added `$username@$hostname` to the beginning of the format string.
4. Configured the `[username]` and `[hostname]` sections to always show and use specific colors.

To implement this:

1. Open your `~/.config/starship.toml` file:
   ```
   nano ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file and exit the editor.
4. Restart your terminal or run `starship init fish | source` to see the changes.

This configuration should give you a prompt that looks something like this:

```
blake@zen-arch ~/current/directory [git branch] ><>
```

The fish symbol (`><>`) will appear in green for successful commands and red for errors.

Is this closer to what you were looking for? If you need any further adjustments or have any questions about the configuration, please let me know!

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:20:19 UTC

if i didnt need the time, i wanted the stylized fish symbol back and i also wanted blake@zen-arch (user@hostname) what would that look like? 

what i found out is that if you use (echo $hostname) it runs without error or warning

---

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:21:49 UTC

it's not quite the fish/omf default..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:21:49 UTC

 I apologize for the misunderstanding. You're right, the stylized fish prompt from Fish/OMF default is different from what I provided. Let's adjust the configuration to more closely resemble the Fish/OMF default prompt.

The classic Fish prompt typically uses a chevron (›) or a triangle (▶) rather than a stylized fish. Let's update the Starship configuration to mimic this style more closely:

<antArtifact identifier="fish-like-starship-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="toml" title="Fish-like Starship Configuration">
# ~/.config/starship.toml

# Define the prompt format
format = """
$username@$hostname\
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$python\
$rust\
$nodejs\
$docker_context\
$line_break\
$character"""

# Character configuration (Fish-like)
[character]
success_symbol = "[›](bold green)"
error_symbol = "[›](bold red)"
vimcmd_symbol = "[·](bold green)"

# Username configuration
[username]
style_user = "bold cyan"
format = "[$user]($style)"
show_always = true

# Hostname configuration
[hostname]
ssh_only = false
format = "[$hostname](bold blue)"
disabled = false

# Directory configuration
[directory]
style = "blue bold"
read_only = " ro"
truncation_length = 3
truncate_to_repo = false

# Git configurations
[git_branch]
symbol = ""
style = "green"

[git_status]
format = '([\[$all_status$ahead_behind\]]($style) )'
style = "red"

# Rest of your configuration remains the same...
</antArtifact>

Key changes in this configuration:

1. Changed the `[character]` section to use a chevron (`›`) instead of the stylized fish. This is more in line with the classic Fish prompt.
2. Adjusted the directory display to truncate after 3 folders, which is more similar to the Fish default.
3. Removed the `git` symbol from the branch display and adjusted the git status format for a cleaner look.

The rest of your configuration (language symbols, etc.) remains the same as in your previous setup.

This should result in a prompt that looks more like the classic Fish prompt:

```
blake@zen-arch ~/c/d/project (main) ›
```

Where:
- The directory is truncated to 3 levels
- Git branch is shown without a symbol
- The prompt ends with a chevron (›) which is green for success and red for errors

To implement this:

1. Open your `~/.config/starship.toml` file:
   ```
   nano ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Save the file and exit the editor.
4. Restart your terminal or run `starship init fish | source` to see the changes.

Is this closer to the Fish/OMF default you were expecting? If you need any further adjustments to make it look more like the classic Fish prompt, please let me know, and we can fine-tune it further.

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:23:35 UTC

no, it might be a glyph or an icon of some sort.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:23:35 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and thank you for your patience. The Fish shell's default prompt often includes a fish icon glyph, which might not render correctly in all terminals or fonts. Let's try to incorporate this fish icon into your Starship prompt.

<antThinking>We need to find a suitable fish icon that works across different terminals and fonts. Unicode offers some fish-like characters that might work. We'll provide a few options for the user to choose from.</antThinking>

Here's an updated Starship configuration with a few fish icon options:

<antArtifact identifier="fish-icon-starship-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="toml" title="Starship Configuration with Fish Icon">
# ~/.config/starship.toml

# Define the prompt format
format = """
$username@$hostname\
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$python\
$rust\
$nodejs\
$docker_context\
$line_break\
$character"""

# Character configuration (Fish icon options)
[character]
# Option 1: Fish
success_symbol = "[🐟](bold green)"
error_symbol = "[🐟](bold red)"
# Option 2: Tropical Fish
# success_symbol = "[🐠](bold green)"
# error_symbol = "[🐠](bold red)"
# Option 3: Blowfish
# success_symbol = "[🐡](bold green)"
# error_symbol = "[🐡](bold red)"
# Option 4: Fish Cake (often renders as a fish)
# success_symbol = "[🍥](bold green)"
# error_symbol = "[🍥](bold red)"
vimcmd_symbol = "[·](bold green)"

# Username configuration
[username]
style_user = "bold cyan"
format = "[$user]($style)"
show_always = true

# Hostname configuration
[hostname]
ssh_only = false
format = "[$hostname](bold blue)"
disabled = false

# Directory configuration
[directory]
style = "blue bold"
read_only = " ro"
truncation_length = 3
truncate_to_repo = false

# Git configurations
[git_branch]
symbol = ""
style = "green"

[git_status]
format = '([\[$all_status$ahead_behind\]]($style) )'
style = "red"

# Rest of your configuration remains the same...
</antArtifact>

Key changes in this configuration:

1. Added several fish icon options using Unicode emoji characters. You can uncomment the option you prefer.
2. Kept the rest of the configuration the same as before.

To implement this:

1. Open your `~/.config/starship.toml` file:
   ```
   nano ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```
2. Replace the entire contents with the code from the artifact above.
3. Choose your preferred fish icon by uncommenting the corresponding lines in the `[character]` section.
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Restart your terminal or run `starship init fish | source` to see the changes.

This should result in a prompt that looks something like this:

```
blake@zen-arch ~/c/d/project (main) 🐟
```

The fish icon will be green for successful commands and red for errors.

Please note that the appearance of these icons can vary depending on your terminal and font settings. If none of these options render correctly or to your liking, we can explore other Unicode characters or custom font options.

Is this closer to what you were looking for? If you need any further adjustments or if these icons don't render correctly in your terminal, please let me know, and we can explore other options.

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:26:33 UTC

it's the omf default..

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:26:33 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion earlier. Thank you for providing this image - it's incredibly helpful. You're absolutely right; the prompt you're referring to is indeed the Oh My Fish (OMF) default prompt, which uses a stylized fish character that's not a standard Unicode glyph.

The fish character you're seeing is a custom glyph that's typically part of a powerline-patched font. It's not a standard Unicode character, which is why it wasn't appearing in our previous attempts.

To replicate this in Starship, we'll need to use the correct character. The exact character code may vary depending on the font, but a common one for this fish glyph is `\uf578`.

Let's update your Starship configuration to use this glyph:

<antArtifact identifier="omf-like-starship-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="toml" title="OMF-like Starship Configuration">
# ~/.config/starship.toml

# Define the prompt format
format = """
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$character"""

# Character configuration (OMF-like fish)
[character]
success_symbol = "[](bold cyan)"
error_symbol = "[](bold red)"
vimcmd_symbol = "[](bold green)"

# Directory configuration
[directory]
style = "cyan bold"
read_only = " "
truncation_length = 1
truncate_to_repo = false

# Git configurations
[git_branch]
symbol = " "
style = "green"

[git_status]
format = '([$all_status$ahead_behind]($style) )'
style = "red"

# You can keep the rest of your configuration (language symbols, etc.) as it was
</antArtifact>

Key points about this configuration:

1. We've used the fish glyph `\uf578` for the prompt character. This should display as the stylized fish if you have a compatible font installed.
2. The directory is set to cyan to match your screenshot.
3. Git branch symbol is set to a blank space, as it appears to be in your image.
4. The format has been simplified to match what's visible in your screenshot.

To use this configuration:

1. Make sure you have a powerline-patched font installed and set in your terminal (fonts like Fira Code, Hack, or any Nerd Font should work).
2. Update your `~/.config/starship.toml` with this new configuration.
3. Restart your terminal or run `starship init fish | source`.

If the fish glyph doesn't appear correctly, it might be because your terminal font doesn't include this character. In that case, you may need to install a powerline-patched font or a Nerd Font.

Is this closer to the OMF default prompt you were aiming for? Let me know if you need any further adjustments or if you have any issues with the font rendering the fish glyph.

---

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:28:52 UTC

just looking at it in the code window here, that doesn't look quite right.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:28:52 UTC

 I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and thank you for pointing that out. The fish glyph might not be rendering correctly in the code window or might be using a different character than what's actually in the OMF default prompt. Let's try a different approach.

The OMF default prompt often uses a specific Unicode character for the fish. Let's try using a more standard Unicode fish character that might be more widely supported:

<antArtifact identifier="omf-like-starship-config-unicode" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="toml" title="OMF-like Starship Configuration with Unicode Fish">
# ~/.config/starship.toml

# Define the prompt format
format = """
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$character"""

# Character configuration (OMF-like fish using Unicode)
[character]
success_symbol = "[❯](bold cyan)"
error_symbol = "[❯](bold red)"
vimcmd_symbol = "[❮](bold green)"

# Directory configuration
[directory]
style = "cyan bold"
read_only = " "
truncation_length = 1
truncate_to_repo = false

# Git configurations
[git_branch]
symbol = " "
style = "green"

[git_status]
format = '([$all_status$ahead_behind]($style) )'
style = "red"

# You can keep the rest of your configuration (language symbols, etc.) as it was
</antArtifact>

In this configuration:

1. We've used the Unicode character `❯` (U+276F) for the prompt character. This is a right-pointing angle bracket, which is often used as an alternative when the fish glyph isn't available.
2. For the vim command mode, we use `❮` (U+276E), which is a left-pointing angle bracket.
3. The rest of the configuration remains the same as in the previous version.

This should provide a prompt that looks similar to the OMF default, even if the exact fish glyph isn't available. The prompt will look something like this:

```
~/current/directory (git-branch) ❯
```

If you still prefer a fish-like character and your terminal supports it, we could try using the actual fish emoji `🐟` (U+1F41F):

```toml
[character]
success_symbol = "[🐟](bold cyan)"
error_symbol = "[🐟](bold red)"
vimcmd_symbol = "[🐠](bold green)"
```

Would either of these options work better for you? If not, could you describe what the fish character looks like in your OMF prompt? Is it more angular, rounded, or does it have any specific features we should try to replicate?

**Human** - 2024-09-03 23:29:20 UTC

Can you explain this section to me in more detail?

```
"""
```

---

**Assistant** - 2024-09-03 23:29:20 UTC

 Certainly! I'd be happy to explain that section in more detail.

The triple quotes `"""` in the Starship configuration file are used to define a multi-line string. This is particularly useful for the `format` setting, which determines the overall structure of your prompt.

Let's break it down:

```toml
format = """
$directory\
$git_branch\
$git_status\
$character"""
```

1. The `format` key is being assigned a value.

2. The triple quotes `"""` open a multi-line string. This allows you to spread your prompt format over multiple lines for better readability in the configuration file.

3. Each line within the triple quotes represents a different element of your prompt:
   - `$directory`: Shows your current directory
   - `$git_branch`: Displays the current git branch (if in a git repository)
   - `$git_status`: Shows git status information
   - `$character`: This is typically the symbol at the end of your prompt (like the fish or angle bracket we discussed)

4. The backslashes `\` at the end of each line (except the last) are important. They tell Starship to not include a line break between these elements in the actual prompt.

5. The closing `"""` ends the multi-line string.

This format means your prompt will display the directory, followed immediately by git information (if applicable), and end with the prompt character, all on a single line.

If you wanted elements on separate lines, you could remove the backslashes. For example:

```toml
format = """
$directory
$git_branch
$git_status
$character"""
```

This would put each element on a new line in your prompt.

The multi-line string format allows for easy reading and editing of your prompt structure in the configuration file, while giving you fine-grained control over how the prompt actually appears in your terminal.
