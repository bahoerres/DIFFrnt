i can't confirm for certain that this is the case, but when spotify is open on  my desktop computer it has a hard time going to sleep/turning off the screen. like it'll power down for a second, and then pop back up. 

it doesnt matter what the state of spotify is, playing, paused, on screen, minimized. just a weird behavior? or is there a setting, whether it's in windows or spotify that i can set to fix this?

 This is an interesting issue you're experiencing with Spotify and your computer's sleep mode. It's not an uncommon problem, and there are a few potential causes and solutions we can explore:

1. Spotify's hardware acceleration: 
   Try disabling hardware acceleration in Spotify settings. This can sometimes interfere with sleep mode.

2. Windows power settings:
   Check your Windows power plan settings. Ensure that media sharing or streaming isn't preventing sleep mode.

3. Spotify's "Show desktop overlay when using media keys" setting:
   This feature can sometimes interfere with sleep mode. Try disabling it in Spotify settings.

4. Update Spotify and Windows:
   Ensure both Spotify and Windows are up to date, as older versions might have bugs causing this issue.

5. Close Spotify before sleep:
   As a temporary workaround, you could close Spotify before putting your computer to sleep.

6. Check for background processes:
   Use Task Manager to see if Spotify is running any background processes that might be preventing sleep.

7. Reinstall Spotify:
   If none of the above work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Spotify.

Would you like me to provide more detailed steps for any of these potential solutions? Or if you've already tried some of these, let me know, and we can explore other options.
