At some point we went through setting up a gpg key for my GitHub account. 

I've since been promoted to log in when opening my terminal and well, it's pretty cumbersome. 

Is there a workaround for this?

 If you're being prompted for your GPG passphrase every time you open your terminal or try to sign Git commits, there are a few ways to make this more convenient. The most common solution is to use the GPG agent, which can cache your passphrase for a certain period.

Here's how to set it up:

1. First, ensure gpg-agent is running (it usually starts automatically with GPG2)

2. Create or edit your gpg-agent.conf file:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
nano ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```

3. Add these lines to the file:
```
default-cache-ttl 3600    # Cache timeout in seconds (1 hour)
max-cache-ttl 43200      # Maximum time a cache entry is valid (12 hours)
```

4. Make sure your shell is configured to use gpg-agent. Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

5. Reload the agent:
```bash
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
gpg-agent --daemon
```

Now the agent will cache your passphrase for the specified time after you enter it once.

If you want to be even more aggressive with caching, you can increase the cache-ttl values. For example, setting them to 34560000 would cache for 400 days, though this trades security for convenience.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
