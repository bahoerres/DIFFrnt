let's go ahead and get this converted into a spreadsheet for quick reference. 

if there's anything that stands out, i'm open for discussion, but would like the cheatsheet for the setup as is. please and thank you.

</antArtifact>

A few observations about your shortcut setup:

1. You have several productivity-focused plugins configured (Spaced Repetition, Day Planner, Templater, etc.)
2. Some common commands like "workspace:split-vertical" and "workspace:split-horizontal" don't have shortcuts assigned
3. You have multiple quick-access shortcuts for pane navigation (Pane Relief plugin)
4. You're using the Zotero connector for academic reference management

Would you like me to suggest any potential shortcut optimizations or discuss any specific aspects of the configuration?

**Human** - 2024-11-16 03:47:38 UTC

i have hyprland bindings that make Alt+return and modifiers a problem. 

i do have a .obsidian.vimrc wouldn't it be *almost* just as clean/easy to put a couple of leader motions (like it would for obsidian.nvim) for following links?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-16 03:47:38 UTC

 Ah yes, using a .obsidian.vimrc would be a great alternative for link navigation, especially if you're having conflicts with your Hyprland bindings. This would also feel more natural if you're already comfortable with Vim motions.

Here are some example .obsidian.vimrc mappings you could use to replace those Alt+Enter bindings:

```vim
" Follow link under cursor
exmap followLink obcommand editor:follow-link
nmap <Leader>f :followLink

" Open link in new split
exmap openLinkInNewPane obcommand editor:open-link-in-new-leaf
nmap <Leader>F :openLinkInNewPane

" Optional: Additional link-related mappings you might find useful
" Jump to next/previous links on the page
exmap jumpToLink obcommand mrj-jump-to-link:activate-jump-to-link
nmap ]l :jumpToLink

exmap jumpToAnywhere obcommand mrj-jump-to-link:activate-jump-to-anywhere
nmap gl :jumpToAnywhere
```

This approach has several advantages:
1. Avoids conflict with your window manager
2. Maintains keyboard-centric navigation
3. Consistent with Vim muscle memory
4. More flexible for adding related link operations

Would you like me to suggest additional Vim mappings for other common Obsidian operations that might currently be using Alt combinations?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-16 03:49:01 UTC

now that we're discussing some of the details, are there any others here that could be translated to a vim motion?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-16 03:49:01 UTC

 Let's analyze the current shortcuts and identify good candidates for vim motions. I'll organize these by their suitability and potential vim mapping patterns.



<antArtifact identifier="obsidian-vim-mappings" type="text/markdown" title="Obsidian Vim Motion Alternatives">
# Obsidian Vim Motion Alternatives

## High Priority Replacements (Common Operations)
```vim
" === Link Navigation ===
" Follow link under cursor
exmap followLink obcommand editor:follow-link
nmap <Leader>f :followLink

" Open link in new split
exmap openLinkInNewPane obcommand editor:open-link-in-new-leaf
nmap <Leader>F :openLinkInNewPane

" === Line Operations ===
" Move lines up/down (currently Alt + Arrow)
exmap moveLineUp editor:swap-line-up
exmap moveLineDown editor:swap-line-down
nmap [e :moveLineUp
nmap ]e :moveLineDown

" === Task Management ===
" Toggle checkbox (currently Ctrl + Space)
exmap toggleCheckbox editor:toggle-completed
nmap <Leader>x :toggleCheckbox

" === Search and Navigation ===
" Global search (currently Mod + Shift + F)
exmap searchEverything global-search:open
nmap <Leader>/ :searchEverything

" === Sidebar and View Controls ===
" Toggle left/right sidebars (currently Mod + R/L)
exmap toggleLeftSidebar app:toggle-left-sidebar
exmap toggleRightSidebar app:toggle-right-sidebar
nmap <Leader>h :toggleLeftSidebar
nmap <Leader>l :toggleRightSidebar

" === Daily Notes ===
" Navigate daily notes (currently various Mod combinations)
exmap nextDailyNote daily-notes:goto-next
exmap prevDailyNote daily-notes:goto-prev
nmap ]d :nextDailyNote
nmap [d :prevDailyNote

" === Block Operations ===
" Extract selection (currently Alt + C/Alt + Shift + C)
exmap extractContent note-refactor-obsidian:app:extract-selection-content-only
exmap extractFirstLine note-refactor-obsidian:app:extract-selection-first-line
nmap <Leader>ec :extractContent
nmap <Leader>ef :extractFirstLine
```

## Additional Useful Mappings
```vim
" === Review Features ===
" Spaced repetition review (currently Mod + 1/2/3)
exmap reviewEasy obsidian-spaced-repetition:note-review-easy
exmap reviewHard obsidian-spaced-repetition:note-review-hard
exmap reviewOpen obsidian-spaced-repetition:note-review-open-note
nmap <Leader>re :reviewEasy
nmap <Leader>rh :reviewHard
nmap <Leader>ro :reviewOpen

" === Zotero Integration ===
" Zotero operations (currently Alt + Z/X)
exmap zoteroImport obsidian-zotero-desktop-connector:zdc-exp-Import Paper
exmap zoteroCite obsidian-zotero-desktop-connector:zdc-Cite
nmap <Leader>zi :zoteroImport
nmap <Leader>zc :zoteroCite

" === Highlighting ===
" Text highlighting (currently Mod + H)
exmap highlight highlightr-plugin:highlighter-plugin-menu
exmap unhighlight highlightr-plugin:unhighlight
nmap <Leader>h :highlight
nmap <Leader>H :unhighlight

" === Graph and Workspace ===
" Graph view (currently Mod + G)
exmap localGraph graph:open-local
exmap globalGraph graph:open
nmap <Leader>gl :localGraph
nmap <Leader>gg :globalGraph
```

## Suggested Mnemonic Pattern for Leader Keys
- `<Leader>f` - Following/finding (links, search)
- `<Leader>z` - Zotero operations
- `<Leader>r` - Review operations
- `<Leader>e` - Extract operations
- `<Leader>g` - Graph operations
- `<Leader>h/l` - Left/right sidebar toggles
- `[` and `]` - Navigation operations (daily notes, lines)

## Notes
1. These mappings assume you're using the default `\` leader key. Adjust if you use a different leader.
2. The mnemonic pattern tries to be consistent with common vim plugins (like vim-unimpaired for `[` and `]` mappings).
3. Some operations might benefit from visual mode mappings as well.
4. Consider adding visual mode mappings for operations that work with selections.
</antArtifact>

Key benefits of this approach:

1. **Reduced Conflicts**: Eliminates potential conflicts with Hyprland and other system shortcuts
2. **Vim Consistency**: Follows common vim plugin patterns (especially with `[` and `]` for navigation)
3. **Mnemonic Organization**: Grouped by function with consistent leader patterns
4. **Modal Efficiency**: Takes advantage of vim's modal editing for more precise operations

Would you like me to:
1. Focus on any particular category of these mappings?
2. Suggest additional mappings for specific workflows?
3. Help with implementing and testing any of these mappings?

Need any adjustments to the mappings or additional functionality?

clipboard being unnamed, what's the idea there?

 The `set clipboard=unnamed` setting makes Obsidian's vim mode share the system clipboard, allowing you to copy/paste between Obsidian and other applications. Without it, vim's registers remain separate from the system clipboard, which can be frustrating when trying to move text between applications.

Alternative options:
- `set clipboard=unnamedplus` (for Linux, uses the selection clipboard)
- Remove it entirely if you prefer explicit clipboard management via registers

Would you like to change this setting or learn more about vim clipboard handling?

ahh, that's what i thought. i do want it to be system.. i didn't realize that the  vim integration went that deep.

 Yes, the vim emulation in Obsidian is quite robust! Beyond clipboard integration, it also supports:
- Custom mappings for Obsidian-specific commands
- Most standard vim motions and operators
- Register operations
- Macros
- Visual mode selections
- Basic vim settings like relativenumber, ignorecase, etc.

Would you like to explore any other vim features in your Obsidian setup?

this would go inside .obsidian/ in the vault root?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-20 19:15:20 UTC

 Yes, the `.obsidian.vimrc` file should be placed in your vault's `.obsidian` directory, alongside other configuration files like `app.json` and `hotkeys.json`.

Full path would be: `your-vault-path/.obsidian/.obsidian.vimrc`
