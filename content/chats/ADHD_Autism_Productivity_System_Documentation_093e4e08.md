# Context Setting
We've been developing a comprehensive ADHD/autism-focused productivity and executive function support system, documented in an Obsidian vault. The system emphasizes energy-aware task management, pattern recognition, and sustainable maintenance practices.
# Current Progress
- Created core system architecture including Emergency Protocol, Energy States, Quick Wins, Task Menus
- Developed Pattern Recognition framework split into interconnected notes
- Established maintenance protocols for both system and personal sustainability
- Created mobile-friendly quick reference cards
- Actively working on expanding state transition protocols
# Active Discussion
Currently detailing the Zombie Mode state, which requires:
- Deeper explanation of characteristics
- Practical management strategies
- Integration with other system components
- Specific tooling and support needs
# Core System Philosophy
- Energy-state awareness drives task selection
- Pattern recognition enables system optimization
- Quick wins build momentum
- Flexible, sustainable approaches prevent burnout
- Integration between components maintains usability
# Knowledge Base Links
Key documentation includes [[Energy States]], [[Pattern Recognition]], [[Quick Wins List]], [[Task Menus]], [[System Maintenance]], with linked mobile reference cards and transition protocols.
# Continuation Goals
1. Complete Zombie Mode detailed explanation
2. Develop remaining state transition protocols
3. Enhance system integration documentation

 Let me focus on developing the Zombie Mode state documentation, integrating it with your existing system while maintaining consistency with established patterns.

<antThinking>This requires a comprehensive document that will serve as a core reference, making it ideal for an artifact. It needs to integrate with existing documentation while maintaining consistent formatting and linking structure.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="zombie-mode-documentation" type="text/markdown" title="Zombie Mode State Documentation">
# Zombie Mode

## Characteristics
- Severely depleted executive function
- Minimal task initiation capacity 
- Reduced decision-making ability
- Time blindness intensification
- Difficulty with complex instructions
- Increased sensory sensitivity

## Recognition Patterns
- Task paralysis despite urgency
- Circular thinking without action
- Basic self-care challenges
- Environmental overwhelm
- Difficulty articulating needs
- Screen hyperfocus without productivity

## Management Strategies

### Immediate Actions
1. Activate Emergency Protocol
2. Implement minimum viable routine
3. Use pre-prepared task menu
4. Enable Do Not Disturb
5. Access comfort items list

### Recovery Path
1. Basic needs check

    [*] --> ZombieMode
    ZombieMode --> EmergencyProtocol: Activation
    EmergencyProtocol --> BasicNeeds: Stabilization
    BasicNeeds --> LowEnergy: Recovery
    LowEnergy --> [*]: Gradual Return
```

## Mobile Reference Card
```markdown
# üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Zombie Mode Quick Reference

1. STOP - Don't make decisions
2. ACTIVATE - Emergency Protocol
3. CHECK - Basic needs list
4. USE - Prepared responses
5. REST - Until baseline returns

Emergency Contacts: [List]
Safe Spaces: [List]
Comfort Items: [List]
```

## Tooling Requirements
- Simplified task interface
- One-click protocol activation
- Pre-written communication templates
- Environment adjustment checklist
- Recovery tracking minimal metrics
- Support network quick access

## Maintenance Notes
- Update Emergency Protocol monthly
- Review comfort items quarterly
- Validate contact information
- Adjust recovery metrics
- Document pattern variations

**Human** - 2024-10-30 14:12:34 UTC

I really like that context for the mobile reference: my previous efforts produced some that look like: YOU ARE HERE IF:
- Brain foggy
- Body heavy
- Can't start
- Sensory ow
QUICK ACTIONS:
1. Water + protein
2. 2min movement
3. One tiny task
4. Comfort tool
USE:
- Quick Wins only
- Physical tasks
- Known routines

think we could combine the two?

**Human** - 2024-10-30 14:18:40 UTC

let's flesh out (hah, zombies, flesh.. ) a Emergency Momentum Protocol for that link. I've just got this real basic framework currently. 


```markdown
CATCH THE SPARK:
1. DON'T PREP MORE - START NOW
2. Set timer for 10 minutes
3. Pick ONE thing only
4. Give yourself points
5. Record what worked
WHEN STUCK:
- Change one constraint
- Move to a different spot
- Pick a smaller chunk
- Add novelty/game element
MAINTAIN MOMENTUM:
- Keep timer visible
- Stack small wins
- Note energy level
- Prep next task while motivated
```

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-30 14:18:40 UTC

 <antThinking>This needs to be expanded into a comprehensive protocol while maintaining the quick-action nature. It's a core system component that deserves artifact treatment.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="emergency-momentum" type="text/markdown" title="Emergency Momentum Protocol">
# Emergency Momentum Protocol

## CATCH THE SPARK
1. START IMMEDIATELY
   - No prep, no lists
   - Use what's in front of you
   - Perfection hostile to momentum

2. SET CONSTRAINTS
   - 10min timer visible
   - One task only
   - Physical > Digital
   - Location matters

3. POINTS SYSTEM
   - +1 per tiny step
   - +2 body movement
   - +3 completing anything
   - +5 chain reactions

## STUCK? CHANGE ONE THING
### Environment
- Move to different room
- Change lighting/sound
- Stand vs. sit
- Face different direction

### Task
- Halve the scope
- Switch to physical
- Add playful element
- Race the timer

### Energy
- 30sec movement
- Water/snack
- Temperature change
- Quick sensory tool

## MAINTAIN MOMENTUM
### Track
- Current points
- Energy shifts
- Time awareness
- Location effects

### Stack
- Chain small wins
- Note patterns
- Prep next while strong
- Document discoveries

## Emergency Overrides
- Zombie Mode ‚Üí Physical only
- Overwhelm ‚Üí Tiny steps
- Time blind ‚Üí Timer essential
- Analysis freeze ‚Üí Just move

Remember: Momentum > Perfection
</antArtifact>

Want to adjust the balance between structure and quick-action elements?

Moving in the right direction. feel free to use charts and diagrams and even dataview queries when applicable. i'm pretty competent with obsidian

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-30 14:22:33 UTC

 Which link would you like to develop first? We can build out:

1. [[Timer Widget]]
2. [[Task Paralysis]]
3. Power locations tracking
4. State transitions
5. Points/streaks system

Or we could focus on the dataview queries needed to make the dashboard functional.

Want me to add any specific features to enhance momentum tracking?

**Human** - 2024-10-30 14:26:12 UTC

no, but how would i integrate that into my vault?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-30 14:26:12 UTC

 To integrate this React component in your Obsidian vault, you'll need:

1. Install the ReactJS View plugin
2. Create a new view file in your vault:
```
{FolderPath}/timer-widget.jsx
```

3. Add this to your Timer Widget note:
```markdown
# Timer Widget

```reactjs
[[timer-widget.jsx]]
```
```

4. Reference it in other notes using:
```markdown
![[Timer Widget]]
```

Want guidance on the ReactJS View plugin setup?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-30 14:28:27 UTC

"React Components" plugin?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-30 14:28:27 UTC

 Yes, "React Components" is the correct plugin. You'll need to:

1. Install "React Components" from Obsidian Community Plugins
2. Create `timer-widget.jsx` file
3. Reference with:
```markdown
```react
<MyTimer/>
```
```

The previous artifact formatting would need adjustment to work with this plugin. Would you like me to provide the adapted version?

**Human** - 2024-10-31 20:53:01 UTC

i have an issue with a sun that created a number of duplicate files. all of them, actually. 

is there a command that i can wildcard to remove any files with .sync?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-31 20:53:01 UTC

 Yes! If you're comfortable with the command line, you can remove all .sync files with:

```bash
rm *.sync
```

If you want to be more specific to only target the location where these files are, you can use:

```bash
rm /path/to/folder/*.sync
```

If you want to see what would be deleted first (recommended), you can list them:

```bash
ls *.sync
```

Or if you're on Windows, using PowerShell:
```powershell
Remove-Item *.sync
```

If you want to do this recursively (including all subdirectories), use:

Unix/Linux/Mac:
```bash
find . -name "*.sync" -type f -delete
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Filter *.sync -Recurse | Remove-Item
```

Would you like me to explain any of these commands in more detail?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-31 20:53:20 UTC

fish?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-31 20:53:20 UTC

 For fish shell, you can use:

```fish
rm *.sync
```

Or for recursive deletion in subdirectories:

```fish
find . -name "*.sync" -type f -delete
```

Fish is generally compatible with basic Unix commands, so the simple `rm` command works the same way. If you want to test first, you can list the files:

```fish
ls *.sync
```

Or see what would be deleted recursively:

```fish
find . -name "*.sync" -type f
```

(The last command shows what would be deleted without actually deleting - remove the files only after confirming they're the right ones!)
