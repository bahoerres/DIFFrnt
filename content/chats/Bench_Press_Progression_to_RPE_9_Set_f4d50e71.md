"work up tona hard set of three" for flat barbell bench press at rpe 9. I understand exactly what this means, but I'm confused about one bit. For a lifter with a max bench of 205lbs, walk me through what this looks like.

 Let me walk you through what a "work up to a hard set of three" at RPE 9 would look like for someone with a 205lb max bench press.

First, let me clarify that RPE 9 means you have 1 rep "left in the tank" - you could do one more rep but it would be your absolute limit. For a set of 3, RPE 9 typically corresponds to around 85-87% of your 1RM.

For a 205lb max, here's how the workout would progress:

1. Empty bar (45lbs) x 8-10 reps for warm-up
2. 95lbs x 5 reps (add a 25lb plate to each side)
3. 135lbs x 4 reps (1 plate each side)
4. 165lbs x 3 reps (add a 15lb plate each side)
5. Finally, top set at ~175lbs x 3 reps (this is about 85% of 205)

This final set at 175 should feel like you could maybe get 4 reps if you absolutely had to, but that fourth rep would be a real grinder. If 175 feels too easy (like you could definitely get 5+ reps), you'd go up to 180-185. If it feels too hard (like a true 3-rep max), you'd want to drop to 165-170.

Would you like me to clarify anything about the progression or how to gauge RPE 9?

Nope! I was mostly curious about the dialing in of the set at the end.

 Ah yes - that final "dial in" process is one of the trickier skills in RPE-based training! The fact that you might need to adjust up or down 5-10lbs to hit the right RPE is exactly why many coaches prefer "work up to" rather than prescribing an exact percentage. It accounts for daily readiness while still ensuring you hit the intended stimulus.

Much more elegant than trying to stick to a rigid percentage when you might be extra fresh or a bit fatigued that day. Smart training methodology.
