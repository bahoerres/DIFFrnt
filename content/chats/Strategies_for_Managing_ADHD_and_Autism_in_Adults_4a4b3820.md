**Assistant** - 2024-10-29 14:09:02 UTC

 I'll share some lesser-known but effective approaches for managing executive dysfunction and task avoidance, drawing from both clinical experience and neurodivergent perspectives.

1. Body Doubling
- Simply having another person present (even virtually) while you work
- The presence reduces task paralysis and increases accountability
- Can be done through body doubling apps, video calls, or in-person
- Works because many neurodivergent people process tasks differently in social contexts

2. The "Five Things" Method
- Instead of overwhelming to-do lists, choose exactly five tasks each day
- Must include one very small task (e.g., sending a single email)
- Can use physical tokens or stones to represent each task
- Moving or flipping tokens provides tactile satisfaction

3. The "Swiss Cheese" Approach
- Instead of tackling a task linearly, poke "holes" in it randomly
- Start with whatever part feels easiest or most appealing
- Reduces overwhelm by creating multiple entry points
- Works well for neurodivergent brains that process non-linearly

4. Task Bundling
- Pair dreaded tasks with dopamine-generating activities
- Example: watching a favorite show only while folding laundry
- Creates positive associations and reduces task resistance
- Particularly effective for routine maintenance tasks

5. The "10/10/10" Rule
- Break tasks into 10-minute segments:
  * 10 minutes to start/setup
  * 10 minutes of focused work
  * 10 minutes to wind down/clean up
- More manageable than traditional time blocks
- Built-in transitions help with task switching

6. External Working Memory
- Create physical "stations" for different types of work
- Use visual cues and environmental triggers
- Example: different colored lights for different modes of work
- Reduces cognitive load of context-switching

7. The "Impossible Task" Protocol
- When completely stuck, break down the task into microscopic steps
- Include steps like "look at the thing I need to do"
- Acknowledge and list emotional barriers
- Can seem silly but helps overcome task paralysis

8. Time Blindness Aids
- Use temporal anchors (e.g., "one song length" instead of minutes)
- Visual timers showing time as a disappearing quantity
- Time multiplication rule: multiply estimated time by 2.5
- Schedule by energy levels rather than clock time

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or discuss specific situations where they might be most helpful?

**Human** - 2024-10-29 14:09:02 UTC

Act as a therapist who specializes in ADHD and autism in adults. 

Prove a selection of concepts, frameworks and techniques for aiding with executive dysfunction and task avoidance in improving productivity. 

I'm aware of things like the pomodoro technique and bullet journaling (some of the para concepts I've heard but don't remember). Some things that may be a little less mainstream or even seem a little quirky.

---

**Human** - 2024-10-29 14:12:06 UTC

Not just yet. Body doubling I'm also aware of but find it difficult to practice due to schedule and social constraints. Similar to the 5's I've seen a 1-3-5 of 1 big project, 3 small maintenance items and 5 quick things that include self care. I've also used these as parts of the larger task. Consistency is my issue there.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-29 14:12:06 UTC

 Ah yes, the consistency challenge - very common with ADHD/autism, where traditional accountability systems often don't provide enough immediate feedback or reward.

Let me share some alternative approaches that work well for irregular schedules and solo implementation:

1. "Productivity Pinball"
- Create a physical or digital "game board" of tasks
- Tasks have different point values based on difficulty/importance
- Set a daily/weekly "score" goal rather than specific tasks
- Works because:
  * Gamification provides immediate dopamine hits
  * Flexibility in which tasks you tackle
  * Can't "fail" - only collect different point totals
  * Builds momentum through quick wins

2. The "Menu Method"
- Instead of a to-do list, create task "menus" by energy level
- Categories like: 
  * "Zombie Mode" (tasks you can do even when exhausted)
  * "Spark of Energy" (quick tasks requiring some focus)
  * "Hyperfocus Friendly" (deeper projects)
- Choose based on current state rather than "should"
- Reduces shame around low-energy periods

3. "Productivity Anchors"
- Identify your natural daily patterns/habits
- Attach small tasks to existing behaviors
- Example: "After I make coffee, I always..."
- Works because:
  * Uses established neural pathways
  * Reduces decision fatigue
  * More sustainable than creating new routines

4. The "Constraint Box" Method
- Create a physical or digital box of constraints
- Examples:
  * "Must be done in 10 minutes"
  * "Can only use one hand"
  * "Must be done while standing"
- Randomly select constraints for tasks
- Makes routine tasks novel and interesting
- Particularly helpful for those who thrive on novelty

5. "Task Staging"
- Set up everything needed for tasks in advance
- Create dedicated "task kits" ready to go
- Focus on removing friction rather than completing tasks
- When motivation hits, everything is ready

Would you like me to expand on any of these? They're particularly chosen for their flexibility and ability to work around irregular schedules or low social energy periods.

Also, given what you've mentioned about consistency challenges, I'm curious - do you find your task completion tends to follow any particular patterns, even if they're not the patterns you're aiming for?

# Emergency Momentum Protocol

CATCH THE SPARK:
1. DON'T PREP MORE - START NOW
2. Set timer for 10 minutes
3. Pick ONE thing only
4. Give yourself points
5. Record what worked

WHEN STUCK:
- Change one constraint
- Move to a different spot
- Pick a smaller chunk
- Add novelty/game element

MAINTAIN MOMENTUM:
- Keep timer visible
- Stack small wins
- Note energy level
- Prep next task while motivated
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the vault structure or create additional templates for specific scenarios? Also, since you mentioned Obsidian, we could discuss some specific plugins or dataview queries that might help track patterns in your task completion.

---

**Human** - 2024-10-29 14:39:50 UTC

We will definitely dive deeper. (As my attention darts after a new shiny) I would love to setup a reference to this in my obsidian vault. Could you provide me with a note structure including recommending links between notes based on our discussion? 

An on the fly, organized quick reference or even a few step "pick a task, set a timer, start" sort of cheat sheet in order to attempt to pivot energy?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-29 14:45:50 UTC

Ooh, the check ins and task details would be great as a template in todoist.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-29 14:45:50 UTC

 I'll create a Todoist-friendly format that maintains the ADHD-friendly structure while working within Todoist's capabilities (using their task format, labels, and custom fields).

<antThinking>This warrants an artifact since it's a template system that will be used as a reference outside our conversation, and includes specific formatting that needs to be preserved.</antThinking>

   - P2: Important but flexible
   - P3: Maintenance tasks
   - P4: Nice to have

3. Custom Fields to Add:
   - Points (1-5)
   - Energy Cost (1-3 spoons)
   - Time Estimate
   - Support Method

4. Quick Add Shortcuts:
   - qq = Quick Win Template
   - dd = Daily Check-in
   - tt = Full Task Template

5. Sections to Create:
   - 🎯 Quick Wins
   - 🔄 Maintenance
   - 🚀 Projects
   - 💡 Ideas/Inbox
</antArtifact>

Would you like me to:
1. Create some example tasks using these templates?
2. Add more specific filter recipes for different scenarios?
3. Suggest some automated task creation flows using Todoist's API?

The templates are designed to work with both quick capture (when motivation hits) and more structured planning sessions. The idea is to have enough structure to support executive function without creating friction when you're in a motivated state.

**Human** - 2024-10-29 23:45:25 UTC

Can you explain this section to me in more detail?

> [[Emotion-Task Bridge]]

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-29 23:45:25 UTC

 Absolutely! The Emotion-Task Bridge system is a neurodivergent-friendly approach that works with your emotional state rather than fighting against it. Let me break this down further.

<antThinking>While comprehensive, this explanation works better as conversation rather than an artifact since it's educational and will likely lead to follow-up questions and discussion.</antThinking>

The core principle is: Instead of trying to force yourself into a specific task regardless of your emotional state, you match tasks to your current emotional energy. This works particularly well for ADHD/autism because:

1. Emotional Intensity
- Many neurodivergent people experience emotions more intensely
- These emotions often come with specific types of energy

**Assistant** - 2024-10-29 23:46:29 UTC

 Ah yes, let me finish explaining the Emotion-Task Bridge system first, and then we can catalog and fill in those empty linked notes! 

2. The Bridge System:
- Frustrated Energy
  * WHY IT WORKS: Frustration comes with physical tension and a need to "do something"
  * BEST TASKS: Physical organizing, decluttering, problem-solving tasks that need "brute force"
  * EXAMPLE: When frustrated with a work project, redirect that energy to reorganizing your desk or files
  * KEY TOOL: Movement-based tasks that use the heightened physical energy

- Scattered Energy
  * WHY IT WORKS: Instead of fighting mental "bouncing," use it for tasks that benefit from varied attention
  * BEST TASKS: Brainstorming, initial project planning, creative work, quick task switching
  * EXAMPLE: Use scattered energy for mind mapping, gathering resources, or initial research
  * KEY TOOL: Multiple capture methods (voice notes, sticky notes, quick sketches)

- Anxious Energy
  * WHY IT WORKS: Anxiety often comes with hyperfocus on details and a need for control
  * BEST TASKS: Detail-oriented work, planning, research, systematic organizing
  * EXAMPLE: Channel anxiety into creating detailed project timelines or research deep-dives
  * KEY TOOL: Structured templates and checklists

- Low/Sad Energy
  * WHY IT WORKS: Acknowledges limited resources while still maintaining productivity
  * BEST TASKS: Simple, routine tasks that provide a sense of accomplishment
  * EXAMPLE: Basic maintenance tasks, gentle organizing, comfort-zone work
  * KEY TOOL: Pre-made "low energy task list" with very small, achievable items

Would you like me to:
1. Create a list of all the empty linked notes we need to fill in?
2. Develop a priority order for filling them?
3. Start with the most crucial missing notes?

I can see several types of empty notes we should address:
- System components (like [[Pattern Recognition]])
- Support tools (like [[System Maintenance]])
- Connection notes (like links between different techniques)
- Template expansions (like specific scenarios for each system)

Which would you like to tackle first?

**Human** - 2024-10-29 23:46:29 UTC

oh i suppose i'll let you get all of the text out. i wasn't expecting that to respond like that. 

i think i've now got a number of links without notes in them that we may need to go back and fill in .

**Assistant** - 2024-10-29 23:47:06 UTC

 I'll start by making a comprehensive list of our empty linked notes from the vault structure.

Would you like me to:
1. Create specific pattern tracking templates for different systems?
2. Develop pattern response protocols for common scenarios?
3. Build integration guides with other systems?
4. Create a quick-reference guide for pattern spotting?

The Pattern Recognition system is designed to help us learn from both successes and failures, making our other systems more effective over time. It's particularly focused on identifying what works for your specific neurology rather than trying to force traditional productivity patterns.

**Human** - 2024-10-30 00:06:43 UTC

this almost seems like it'd be more suitiable for multiple notes. sectioned out a litte.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-30 00:06:43 UTC

 Absolutely! Let's break this down into more manageable, interconnected notes. The Pattern Recognition system could be split into several focused notes that work together.

<antThinking>This reorganization warrants an artifact as it's creating a structured network of notes that will be regularly referenced and built upon.</antThinking>

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 14:59:13 UTC

 From my knowledge cutoff in April 2024, the mobile navigation in Quartz was indeed limited. However, since I can't be completely certain about its current state, I'd suggest a few workarounds that could help improve mobile usability:

1. Creating a dedicated mobile navigation note:
```markdown
# 📱 Mobile Navigation
[[index|🏠 Home]]
[[Emergency Task Start Protocol|🆘 Emergency]]
[[Current Energy State|⚡ Energy]]
[[Quick Wins List|✅ Quick Wins]]
```

2. Adding explicit navigation sections at the bottom of key notes:
```markdown
---
## Quick Nav
⬅️ [[Previous Note]] | 🏠 [[index]] | ➡️ [[Next Note]]

📱 Quick Access:
- [[Emergency Task Start Protocol|🆘 Emergency]]
- [[Current Energy State|⚡ Energy]]
- [[Quick Wins List|✅ Quick Wins]]
```

3. Including collapsible navigation in frontmatter (if supported by your Quartz version):
```yaml
---
title: Page Title
enableMobileNav: true
mobileNavLinks:
  - Emergency Task Start Protocol
  - Current Energy State
  - Quick Wins List
---
```

Would you like me to:
1. Create a dedicated mobile navigation strategy?
2. Design mobile-optimized versions of key notes?
3. Suggest alternative organization methods for better mobile access?

Note: For the most up-to-date information about Quartz's mobile capabilities, you might want to check their current documentation or GitHub repository.

---

**Human** - 2024-11-02 14:59:13 UTC

one thing i couldn't help but noticing, i lose the sidebar/navigation on the quartz website when viewing on mobile. 

i imagine this is just a limitation of the software in it's current state?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-02 15:16:16 UTC

could you give me a quick reference for the links from the index you just provided and the subsequent pages that we've constructed? i think there may be a mismatch in some of the titles. 

and as long as we're running (effectively a diff?) this check, can we get a list of discussed pages vs completed pages? sort of a project roadmap?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 15:16:16 UTC

 I'll help catalog our progress and identify any mismatches or gaps.

**Human** - 2024-11-02 15:21:48 UTC

i guess these were the specific ones i was referencing.. 

and i suppose it would probably be a good idea to - based on the standards set by Quartz devs and what we've discussed - structure a frontmatter that i can template in order to open all new notes with, huh?


Attachments:

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 15:21:48 UTC

 Ah yes! Let's first match these specific links to our notes and then create a standardized frontmatter template.

From the image:
1. Emergency Start → [[Emergency Task Start Protocol]]
2. Energy Check → [[Current Energy State]]
3. Quick Wins → [[Quick Wins List]]
4. Crisis Help → [[Crisis Management]]
5. Today's Tasks → [[Task Menus]]
6. Energy Guide → [[Energy States]]
7. Track Patterns → [[Pattern Recognition]]
8. Maintenance → [[System Maintenance]]

Would you like me to:
1. Create specific templates for other note types?
2. Develop more detailed tag structures?
3. Add additional frontmatter fields?
4. Create implementation examples?

This structure allows for consistent navigation, clear categorization, and proper integration with both Obsidian and Quartz while maintaining the quick-access nature of emergency tools.

**Human** - 2024-11-02 15:23:30 UTC

now, do i have to change the link? or the title to match the link?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 15:23:30 UTC

 When working with Obsidian and Quartz, the actual file name (which creates the link/URL) should typically be in kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens), while the title in the frontmatter can be more readable with proper capitalization and spacing. You don't have to change your existing links - you can use the `aliases` field in the frontmatter to maintain all the ways you want to reference the note.

For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Emergency Task Start Protocol"
description: "Quick access protocol for starting tasks when frozen or overwhelmed"
aliases:
  - "Emergency Start"
  - "🆘 Emergency Start"
  - "Emergency Protocol"
filename: emergency-task-start-protocol
---
```

So in your case:
1. Keep the file names as is (e.g., `emergency-task-start-protocol.md`)
2. Use proper titles in the frontmatter
3. Add the quick-access names as aliases
4. Use either format in your wiki links:
   - `[[emergency-task-start-protocol|🆘 Emergency Start]]`
   - or just `[[emergency-task-start-protocol]]` and let the aliases handle the display

Would you like me to:
1. Create a list of recommended file names matched with their display titles and aliases?
2. Update our previous templates with this naming convention clearly shown?
3. Create examples of how to reference these in different contexts?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-02 15:24:19 UTC

so can we rework that index you provided with proper wikilinks?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 15:24:19 UTC

 I'll revise the index MOC with proper wikilinks, using both the file names and display aliases.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 15:27:28 UTC

 Yes, there's definitely a way to script updating the frontmatter! Since these are markdown files, we could use a simple shell script to add the standardized frontmatter while preserving existing content. Let me help create that script and also suggest some improvements to the file structure.



<antArtifact identifier="frontmatter-script" type="text/markdown" title="Frontmatter Update Script and Structure Recommendations">

## Frontmatter Update Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# update_frontmatter.sh
# Usage: ./update_frontmatter.sh [directory]

updateFrontmatter() {
    local file="$1"
    local title=$(basename "$file" .md | sed 's/-/ /g' | sed 's/\b\(.\)/\u\1/g')
    local date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
    
    # Create temporary file
    temp_file=$(mktemp)
    
    # Check if file already has frontmatter
    if grep -q "^---" "$file"; then
        # Extract existing frontmatter
        sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p' "$file" > "$temp_file"
        # Update only missing fields
        if ! grep -q "^title:" "$temp_file"; then
            sed -i "2i title: \"$title\"" "$temp_file"
        fi
        if ! grep -q "^date:" "$temp_file"; then
            sed -i "2i date: $date" "$temp_file"
        fi
        if ! grep -q "^lastmod:" "$temp_file"; then
            sed -i "2i lastmod: $date" "$temp_file"
        fi
        # Get content after frontmatter
        sed '1,/^---$/d' "$file" > "${temp_file}.content"
    else
        # Create new frontmatter
        cat > "$temp_file" << EOF
---
title: "$title"
description: ""
date: $date
lastmod: $date
tags:
  - efSystem
aliases:
  - "$title"
enableToc: true
nav:
  - text: "🏠 Home"
    link: "index"
---
EOF
        # Get all content
        cat "$file" > "${temp_file}.content"
    fi
    
    # Combine updated frontmatter with content
    cat "$temp_file" > "$file"
    echo "" >> "$file"  # Add blank line after frontmatter
    cat "${temp_file}.content" >> "$file"
    
    # Cleanup
    rm "$temp_file" "${temp_file}.content"
}

# Main script
directory="${1:-.}"  # Use current directory if none specified

# Find all markdown files and update frontmatter
find "$directory" -name "*.md" -type f | while read -r file; do
    echo "Updating frontmatter for: $file"
    updateFrontmatter "$file"
done
```

## File Renaming Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# rename_files.sh
# Usage: ./rename_files.sh [directory]

renameFiles() {
    local file="$1"
    # Convert to lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens
    local newname=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/\s/-/g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
    
    if [ "$file" != "$newname" ]; then
        mv "$file" "$newname"
        echo "Renamed: $file -> $newname"
    fi
}

# Main script
directory="${1:-.}"

find "$directory" -name "*.md" -type f | while read -r file; do
    renameFiles "$file"
done
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Save scripts to your repo root
2. Make executable:
```bash
chmod +x update_frontmatter.sh
chmod +x rename_files.sh
```

3. Run in order:
```bash
./rename_files.sh content/
./update_frontmatter.sh content/
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific frontmatter templates for different note types?
2. Create a script to organize files into the recommended structure?
3. Add validation checks for existing frontmatter?
4. Create a backup system before running updates?

The scripts are designed to be safe and non-destructive, preserving existing content while adding or updating frontmatter as needed.

**Human** - 2024-11-02 15:27:28 UTC

this will probably be helpful to us.. this is a copy from the repo . you can see the command to understand what it's displaying, but mostly wanted to give you the proper structure and filenames.

none of these have the accurate frontmatter at the moment. simply

i bet that just being markdown files, there's a way to script that in the terminal, eh?

**Human** - 2024-11-02 15:28:27 UTC

well, i think you said something about mobile specific frontmatter?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 15:28:27 UTC

 Yes! For mobile-optimized notes (especially our quick reference/emergency notes) we want different frontmatter that emphasizes quick access and readability on mobile devices.

## Directory Structure for Mobile Notes
```markdown
content/
└── cheat-sheets/
    └── mobile/
        ├── emergency-start.md
        ├── spark-mode.md
        ├── zombie-mode.md
        ├── hyperfocus-mode.md
        └── integration-tips.md
```

## CSS Considerations
```css
/* Mobile-optimized styling */
.mobile-optimized {
    max-width: 100%;
    padding: 1rem;
    font-size: 16px;  /* Minimum readable size on mobile */
}

.quick-access {
    font-size: 18px;  /* Slightly larger for emergency access */
    line-height: 1.5;
    padding: 0.5rem;
}

/* Ensure buttons/interactive elements have adequate touch targets */
.mobile-optimized a,
.mobile-optimized button {
    min-height: 44px;
    min-width: 44px;
    padding: 12px;
}
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific mobile templates for different types of quick-access notes?
2. Create validation checks for mobile-specific frontmatter?
3. Add more CSS optimizations for mobile viewing?
4. Create a script to automatically detect which notes should be mobile-optimized?

The mobile-optimized frontmatter is designed to create a better experience on small screens while maintaining quick access to essential functions.

**Human** - 2024-11-02 15:29:57 UTC

okay. let's not let me get too dristracted. 

test scripts on mobile notes only. if successful, move to all notes in main folder

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 15:29:57 UTC

 Smart approach - let's test the script on just the mobile notes first. Looking at your file structure:

```bash
content/Cheat Sheets/Mobile/
├── ⚡ SPARK MODE.md
├── 📱 Emergency Start Card.md
├── 📱 Integration Tips.md
├── 🚀 HYPERFOCUS.md
└── 🧟‍♂️ ZOMBIE MODE.md
```

Let's modify the script to handle these specific files first, including dealing with the emoji characters:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# test_mobile_frontmatter.sh
# Usage: ./test_mobile_frontmatter.sh

# Define target directory
MOBILE_DIR="content/Cheat Sheets/Mobile"

# Function to clean filename for title
cleanTitle() {
    local file="$1"
    # Remove emoji and file extension, clean up spaces
    echo "$file" | sed 's/[📱⚡🚀🧟‍♂️]//g' | sed 's/.md$//' | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//' | sed 's/[[:space:]]*$//'
}

updateMobileFrontmatter() {
    local file="$1"
    local clean_title=$(cleanTitle "$(basename "$file")")
    local date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
    
    echo "Processing: $file"
    echo "Clean title: $clean_title"

    # Create backup
    cp "$file" "${file}.backup"
    
    # Create temporary file
    temp_file=$(mktemp)
    
    # Create new frontmatter
    cat > "$temp_file" << EOF
---
title: "$clean_title"
description: "Quick access mobile reference"
type: quick-access
mobile: true
date: $date
lastmod: $date
tags:
  - efSystem
  - quickAccess
  - mobile
aliases:
  - "$(basename "$file" .md)"  # Preserves emoji in alias
enableToc: false
showNav: true
mobileNav:
  - text: "🏠 Home"
    link: "index"
  - text: "🆘 Emergency"
    link: "emergency-task-start-protocol"
  - text: "⚡ Energy"
    link: "current-energy-state"
mobileFirst: true
cssClass: mobile-optimized quick-access
---
EOF
    
    # Get existing content (excluding any existing frontmatter)
    if grep -q "^---" "$file"; then
        sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/!p' "$file" > "${temp_file}.content"
    else
        cat "$file" > "${temp_file}.content"
    fi
    
    # Combine updated frontmatter with content
    cat "$temp_file" > "$file"
    echo "" >> "$file"  # Add blank line after frontmatter
    cat "${temp_file}.content" >> "$file"
    
    # Cleanup
    rm "$temp_file" "${temp_file}.content"
    
    echo "Updated: $file"
    echo "Backup created: ${file}.backup"
    echo "-------------------"
}

# Main script
echo "Starting mobile frontmatter update..."
echo "Target directory: $MOBILE_DIR"
echo "-------------------"

# Find markdown files in mobile directory and update frontmatter
find "$MOBILE_DIR" -name "*.md" -type f | while read -r file; do
    updateMobileFrontmatter "$file"
done

echo "Complete! Please check the updated files and their backups."
```

Would you like me to:
1. Run this test script on a single file first?
2. Add more specific error handling?
3. Create a validation check to compare before/after?
4. Add a restore function to revert from backups if needed?

This script:
- Only targets the Mobile directory
- Creates backups before making changes
- Preserves emoji in aliases
- Handles special characters in filenames
- Provides feedback about what it's doing

**Human** - 2024-11-02 19:17:50 UTC

the mobileNav property doest seem to work as intended. is that where the css comes in? or do i need a specific plugin?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-02 19:17:50 UTC

 The mobileNav property implementation would depend on the specific Quartz version and configuration you're using. You're right - it would need either CSS styling or a specific component implementation to work.

Let me suggest a more reliable approach using Quartz's supported features:

```yaml
---
title: "Emergency Start"
description: "Quick access emergency protocol"
type: quick-access
tags:
  - efSystem
  - quickAccess
  - mobile
aliases:
  - "🆘 Emergency Start"
  - "Emergency Protocol"
enableToc: false
# Quartz-specific navigation
enableBackLinks: true
quickLinks:
  - "[[index|🏠]]"
  - "[[current-energy-state|⚡]]"
  - "[[quick-wins-list|✅]]"
cssClasses:
  - mobile-optimized
  - quick-access
---
```

Then you could add to your Quartz CSS (usually in `quartz/styles/custom.scss`):

```scss
// Mobile-specific styling
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .mobile-optimized {
    .quickLinks {
      position: sticky;
      top: 0;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-around;
      background: var(--background);
      padding: 0.5rem;
      box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
      
      a {
        padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
        border-radius: 4px;
        min-height: 44px;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Would you like me to:
1. Update the frontmatter script with these Quartz-specific properties?
2. Create more detailed CSS styling options?
3. Look into alternative navigation solutions?
4. Create a test page to verify the functionality?

You might also want to check the Quartz documentation or GitHub issues for the most up-to-date way to handle mobile navigation, as these features can change between versions.
