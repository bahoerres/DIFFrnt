i used to get a confirmation dialog in my terminal (kitty) if i was trying to close the window (via hyprland keyboard shortcut) and there was something open (in this case, typically neovim). 

now, in my kitty.conf i've found a line about 

confirm_os_window_close     0 

but that seems to prompt me every time.. is there another line that would be like a "if process running" version of that?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 16:46:59 UTC

 Let me help clarify the kitty terminal confirmation settings. 

The `confirm_os_window_close` setting in kitty has several possible values that control when the confirmation dialog appears:

- `0`: Never show confirmation
- `1`: Always show confirmation (what you're experiencing now)
- `2`: Show confirmation only if there are background processes running
- `-1`: Show confirmation only if there are background processes that are not direct children of the window

Based on what you described, you probably want to set it to `2`:
```
confirm_os_window_close     2
```

This will give you that "if process running" behavior you're looking for - it will only prompt for confirmation if there are active processes like neovim running in the window.

Would you like me to explain more about how kitty determines what counts as a background process?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 16:47:52 UTC

well, that sure does simplify things.. he may not be known for being an awesome human, but the dev of kitty sure does make for some thoughtful code.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 16:47:52 UTC

 Yeah, Kovid Goyal's attention to detail in kitty is pretty impressive! The granular control over confirmation dialogs is a good example - it's the kind of small but important UX detail that shows deep thought about how people actually use terminals. Especially for things like accidentally closing a window with unsaved work in neovim.

The fact that kitty is GPU-accelerated, has great font rendering, and handles these kinds of practical workflow concerns makes it a solid terminal emulator, regardless of any opinions about the maintainer's communication style that you're alluding to. Sometimes great code and complicated personalities go hand in hand in open source.

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 16:49:51 UTC

let's try and figure out a few other small things.. 

in neovim i used to get a change in the cursor between modes (normal/insert) from the full character rectangle, to a line in the front of the character.. 

i imagine this is somewhere in like core/options.lua in my case (i've got a fairly modular setup utilizing lazy)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 16:49:51 UTC

 Yes, in Neovim you can control the cursor shape per mode using the `guicursor` option. In your modular setup with lazy, this would typically go in your core options configuration.

Here's what you're likely looking for:
```lua
vim.opt.guicursor = {
  'n-v-c:block',    -- Normal, Visual, Command = block cursor
  'i-ci-ve:ver25',  -- Insert, Command-line Insert, Visual-exclude = vertical bar
  'r-cr:hor20',     -- Replace = horizontal bar
  'o:hor50',        -- Operator-pending = horizontal bar
  'a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor',
  'sm:block-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175'
}
```

The key parts for what you described are:
- `n-v-c:block` for the full block cursor in normal mode
- `i-ci-ve:ver25` for the vertical line (25% width) in insert mode

You can adjust the numbers (like `ver25` or `hor20`) to change the thickness of the cursor. If you're using kitty terminal, make sure you also have cursor shape changing enabled in kitty.conf:
```
cursor_shape block
```

Would you like me to explain more about the other cursor options or help troubleshoot if this doesn't solve it?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:00:45 UTC

while i believe i'm only wanting to deal with the first two lines, let's see if there's anything else that stands out to you: 

enable_audio_bell           no
window_padding_width        10

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:00:45 UTC

 Those are good kitty settings you've shown! Let me highlight a few other commonly useful kitty configurations you might want to consider, based on what I can infer about your setup (using hyprland, neovim, etc):

```
# Since you've disabled the bell, you might want to consider visual feedback instead
visual_bell_duration    0.0
# Alternatively, you could do a subtle visual bell:
# visual_bell_duration    0.1

# If you're using a modern font with ligatures (common in dev setups)
disable_ligatures       never

# With hyprland (Wayland), this can be useful for better window detection
linux_display_server   wayland

# Since you care about cursor appearance (from the neovim question)
cursor_blink_interval      0  # Disable cursor blink, or set to 0.5 for subtle blink
```

The `window_padding_width 10` you have is a nice touch for readability. If you're into the aesthetics, you might also consider:
```
# Makes inactive windows slightly dimmer
inactive_text_alpha   0.8

# If you want to adjust the default opacity
background_opacity    0.95
```

Would you like me to explain any of these options in more detail or suggest some other useful configurations?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:01:36 UTC

 Ah, now I see your full config. Looking at your cursor settings:

```lua
-- Commented out:
-- vim.opt.guicursor = 'n-v-c:block,i-ci-ve:ver100/,a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor'
-- Currently active:
vim.opt.guicursor = 'a:block/,a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor'
```

The current setting (`a:block`) sets a block cursor for all modes (`a` means "all"). To get back your mode-specific cursor shapes, you'll want to uncomment the first line and comment out/remove the second line. 

The `ver100` in the commented line means a 100% width vertical bar cursor (essentially a full line at the start of the character) for insert mode. If you want a thinner cursor line in insert mode, you could adjust that number:

```lua
vim.opt.guicursor = 'n-v-c:block,i-ci-ve:ver25/,a:blinkwait700-blinkoff400-blinkon250-Cursor/lCursor'
```

Also, I notice you have some cursor highlighting settings at the bottom:
```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'Cursor', {bg = 'NONE'})
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = 'NONE'})
```
These might be affecting how your cursor appears as well. You might want to adjust or remove these if you want more visible cursor highlighting.

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:07:33 UTC

i don't know what the intention of the last two lines is, but switching the comment from line 1 to line 2 and adjusting the ver to 25 took care of what i was hoping.. 

now what about (i imagine cursorline) the full vertical line that i've seen that follows the cursor(and if im not mistaken, both vertical and horizontal highlighting?)

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:07:33 UTC

 Yes, for the cursor line highlighting, you currently have:

```lua
vim.opt.cursorline = true -- highlight the current line
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = 'NONE'})
```

The first line enables cursor line highlighting, but the last line (that we weren't sure about) is actually setting its background to NONE, effectively making it invisible!

For what you're describing (both vertical and horizontal cursor lines), you'll want:

```lua
vim.opt.cursorline = true    -- horizontal line
vim.opt.cursorcolumn = true  -- vertical line
```

And you might want to remove or modify that `nvim_set_hl` line to actually see the highlighting. The exact appearance will be determined by your colorscheme (which I see is set to 'zenbones').

Would you like me to explain how to customize the appearance of these highlight lines beyond what your colorscheme provides?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:10:39 UTC

 You can specify colors in several ways for the background:

```lua
-- Using hex codes
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = '#3c3836'})

-- Using named colors
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = 'DarkGrey'})

-- Using RGB values
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = '#rgb:3c/38/36'})
```

Since you're using the zenbones colorscheme, you might want to use colors that complement it. Zenbones is designed to be light/dark adaptive, so you might want something subtle like:

```lua
-- For a subtle grey that works in both light/dark modes
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = '#2A2A2A'})
```

You can also specify additional attributes:
```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {
  bg = '#2A2A2A',
  bold = true,    -- Make it bold
  italic = false  -- No italics
})
```

Would you like to experiment with some specific colors or would you prefer to see how to match your current colorscheme's palette?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:10:39 UTC

for the bg = section, what would i put in place of none? a reference to a color? an rgb hexcode? either?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:11:13 UTC

would i need a separate function for cursorcolumn?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:11:13 UTC

 Yes, if you want to style the cursorcolumn differently, you'd need a separate highlight setting:

```lua
-- For the horizontal line (current)
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = '#2A2A2A'})

-- For the vertical line
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorColumn', {bg = '#2A2A2A'})
```

You can use the same color for both to keep it consistent, or use different colors/intensities to distinguish them. For example:

```lua
-- Slightly different shades for each
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorLine', {bg = '#2A2A2A'})
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'CursorColumn', {bg = '#323232'})
```

Remember to also have both enabled:
```lua
vim.opt.cursorline = true
vim.opt.cursorcolumn = true
```

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:21:39 UTC

great! now i have another one, that's for a different, small thing.. haha

i've switched to using bat and have also switched my .zshrc to 

alias cat = 'bat --paging=never' 

the issue that i'm having, is that my zsh autostart calls a script for wall to setup my terminal and it uses 

# -----------------------------------------------------
# AUTOSTART
# -----------------------------------------------------
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Pywal
# -----------------------------------------------------
cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Fastfetch
# -----------------------------------------------------
if [[ $(tty) == *"pts"* ]]; then
    fastfetch --config examples/13
else
    echo
    if [ -f /bin/qtile ]; then
        echo "Start Qtile X11 with command Qtile"
    fi
    if [ -f /bin/hyprctl ]; then
        echo "Start Hyprland with command Hyprland"
    fi
fi

which results in that line being displayed whenever my terminal opens (pretty frequently, as i'm sure you can imagine). is there a way to silence that one particular case of have it ignore the alias via some sort of condition?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:21:39 UTC

 Yes, you can handle this in a few ways. The most straightforward would be to use the full path to the original `cat` command for this specific use case. Here are a couple options:

1. Using the full path to the original `cat`:
```bash
/bin/cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences
```

2. Or you can use `command` which ignores aliases:
```bash
command cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences
```

Both of these will bypass your bat alias and use the original `cat` command. Given the specific use case (pywal sequences), using the original `cat` is actually more appropriate since this isn't meant for human reading and bat's features aren't needed here.

Would you like me to explain any other ways to handle this or explain why using the original `cat` is better for terminal sequences?

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:23:33 UTC

that's very helpful and seems to have worked out just fine. thanks much!

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:23:33 UTC

 You're welcome! If you run into any other terminal or Neovim tweaks you want to make, feel free to ask. Setting up the perfect development environment is always an ongoing process of small improvements like these!

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:26:32 UTC

looks like i might need a little help with this now too.. 

when opening neovim: 

/usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/rpc.lua:800: Spawning language server wi
th cmd: `{ "vscode-json-language-server", "--stdio" }` failed. The language 
server is either not installed, missing from PATH, or not executable.       
/usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/rpc.lua:800: Spawning language server wi
th cmd: `{ "vscode-json-language-server", "--stdio" }` failed. The language 
server is either not installed, missing from PATH, or not executable.

if it's important, i'm opening my modules.json file for waybar config

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:26:32 UTC

 This error is indicating that the JSON Language Server isn't installed. Since you're using a modular setup with lazy.nvim (based on your earlier comments), you'll need to make sure the JSON LSP is properly installed and configured.

Here's how to fix this:

1. First, install the JSON Language Server. Using npm:
```bash
npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted
```

Or if you're on Arch Linux (which I suspect you might be, given your Hyprland usage):
```bash
paru -S vscode-json-language-server
# or
yay -S vscode-json-language-server
```

2. Make sure your LSP configuration includes JSON. In your Neovim config (probably in a file like `lua/plugins/lsp.lua` or similar), you should have something like:

```lua
return {
  {
    "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
    opts = {
      servers = {
        jsonls = {
          -- JSON language server settings if needed
          settings = {
            json = {
              schemas = {
                {
                  fileMatch = { "waybar/config.json", "waybar/config", "modules.json" },
                  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexays/Waybar/master/schema/config.schema.json"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Would you like me to explain more about the schema configuration for waybar specifically, or help troubleshoot if the installation doesn't resolve the issue?

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:28:09 UTC

you suspect correctly.. however paru doesnt seem to be able to find a repo with that name..

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:28:09 UTC

 Ah, for Arch Linux, the package name is slightly different. Try:

```bash
paru -S vscode-json-languageserver
```

Or alternatively, you can install it via npm as mentioned before:
```bash
sudo pacman -S npm  # if you don't have npm installed
npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted
```

The npm version is actually often recommended as it's consistently updated and works across different distributions. However, if you prefer keeping everything through the package manager, the Arch package should work just as well.

Let me know if you still get the error after installing either version!

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:29:35 UTC

that new name was correct.. thanks!

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:29:35 UTC

 Great to hear! If you see other LSP-related errors for different file types, they'll likely follow a similar pattern - you'll just need to install the appropriate language server. Common ones for your setup might be:

```bash
# For bash/shell scripts
paru -S bash-language-server

# For Lua (useful for neovim config)
paru -S lua-language-server

# For CSS/HTML (if you edit your waybar styling)
paru -S vscode-css-languageserver
paru -S vscode-html-languageserver
```

But no need to install them preemptively - you can just add them as you encounter the need!

---

**Human** - 2024-10-27 17:31:19 UTC

ooh! nice! except now it keeps yelling at me about comments not being allowed in json =')

---

**Assistant** - 2024-10-27 17:31:19 UTC

 Ah yes, standard JSON doesn't allow comments, which can be frustrating when configuring things like waybar! You have a couple options:

1. Use JSONC (JSON with Comments) - many modern editors support this. In Neovim, you can tell it to treat your file as JSONC by either:
   - Renaming your file to end in `.jsonc`
   - Or adding a modeline at the top of your file:
   ```jsonc
   // vim: filetype=jsonc
   ```

2. Or you can use waybar's alternate configuration format - they actually support a JSON5-like format that allows comments if you name your config file `config` instead of `config.json` (same for `modules`).

The second option is probably more convenient since waybar explicitly supports it. You could just rename your `modules.json` to `modules` and keep your comments!

Would you like me to explain more about the differences between these formats or help with converting your config?
