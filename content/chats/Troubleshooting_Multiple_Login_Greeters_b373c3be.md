i'm experiencing a behavior that i'm not entirely sure how to troubleshoot. 

recently i installed greetd and tui-greet via paru. on startup, and on logout tui-greet appears as expected. if my computer goes idle/to sleep/etc. and i have to log back in to wake, that's a different greeter... 

where do i start?

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:43:52 UTC

 Let me help you troubleshoot this. This behavior suggests you're likely dealing with two different greeters - tui-greet for initial login/logout, and probably swaylock or another locker for idle/suspend scenarios.

Let's check a few key places:

```bash
# Check what's handling idle/sleep
ls -l /etc/systemd/system/sleep.target.wants/
systemctl status swaylock-idle.service 2>/dev/null

# See what's configured in Hyprland
cat ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf | grep -i "lock\|idle"
```

Most likely, you have either:
1. A default screen locker configured in Hyprland
2. A systemd service managing locks on sleep/suspend

Could you run those commands and share what you find? That will help us identify what's handling your screen locking separately from tui-greet.

Also, is swaylock or any other screen locker installed on your system? Check with:
```bash
paru -Qs swaylock
paru -Qs lock
```

     ls -l /etc/systemd/system/sleep.target.wants/
     systemctl status swaylock-idle.service 2>/dev/null
     # See what's configured in Hyprland
     cat ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf | grep -i "lock\|idle"
"/etc/systemd/system/sleep.target.wants/": No such file or directory (os error 2)
exec-once = hypridle
    numlock_by_default = true

windowrule = idleinhibit fullscreen, firefox
bind = CTRL ALT, L, exec, hyprlock -c /home/blake/.config/hyprlock/hyprlock.conf
bindl = , switch:Lid Switch, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:44:32 UTC

 Ah, now we're getting somewhere. You're using hypridle and hyprlock (which are the Hyprland-specific solutions) rather than swaylock. This explains the dual behavior.

The key lines from your config:
```bash
exec-once = hypridle
bind = CTRL ALT, L, exec, hyprlock -c /home/blake/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf
bindl = , switch:Lid Switch, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock
```

Let's check your hypridle configuration:
```bash
cat ~/.config/hypridle/hypridle.conf
```

And see what's in your lock script:
```bash
cat ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock
```

The issue is likely that your system is using hyprlock for idle/sleep states while tui-greet handles the actual session management. To standardize the behavior, you'll need to either:

1. Configure hypridle to use tui-greet for locking
2. Stick with hyprlock and adjust its theme to match tui-greet

Which approach would you prefer? Once you share the contents of those files, I can provide the specific changes needed.

 No worries about bat - it actually makes the output more readable! Now I can see exactly what's happening:

Your hypridle config is triggering `loginctl lock-session` after 10 minutes (line 31-32), which is ultimately calling hyprlock through your general settings (line 7). This explains why you're seeing hyprlock instead of tui-greet for idle/sleep cases.

You have two options:

1. Keep tui-greet for session management only (login/logout) and hyprlock for idle/lock:
   - This is your current setup and is actually quite common
   - hyprlock is generally better suited for screen locking (faster, lighter)

2. Use tui-greet for everything:
```bash
# Edit ~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf
general {
    lock_cmd = tuigreet
    before_sleep_cmd = tuigreet
}

# And modify your lock script
echo 'tuigreet' > ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock
chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock
```

I'd recommend option 1 (your current setup) because:
- hyprlock is purpose-built for screen locking
- tui-greet is better suited for session management
- The separation of concerns is actually good practice

Would you like to keep the current setup or switch to using tui-greet exclusively?

hyprlock often times is klunky logging back in as the cursor doesnt seem to start in the password field. also, if i'm gonna be dealing with hyprlock can we do some background image/blur/whatever magic?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:47:29 UTC

 Let's improve your hyprlock experience! I'll help you configure a nicer setup for hyprlock. First, let's create a proper config file instead of passing all those arguments via CLI.

```bash
# Create/edit hyprlock config
mkdir -p ~/.config/hyprlock
nvim ~/.config/hyprlock/hyprlock.conf
```

Here's a cleaner config with background blur and auto-focus:



<antArtifact identifier="hyprlock-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Hyprlock Configuration">
background {
    monitor =
    path = screenshot   # Screenshot is the default, you can also set a custom background
    blur_size = 4
    blur_passes = 3   # More passes = more resource intensive
    noise = 0.0117    # Noise makes the blur more organic
    contrast = 0.8916 # Adjust to make background darker/lighter
    brightness = 0.8167
    vibrancy = 0.1696
    vibrancy_darkness = 0.0
}

input-field {
    monitor =
    size = 200, 50
    outline_thickness = 3
    dots_size = 0.33 # Scale of input-field height (0.33 = 33%)
    dots_spacing = 0.15
    dots_center = false
    dots_rounding = -1
    outer_color = rgb(151515)
    inner_color = rgb(200, 200, 200)
    font_color = rgb(10, 10, 10)
    fade_on_empty = true
    placeholder_text = <i>Password...</i> # Text rendered in the input box when it's empty.
    hide_input = false
    rounding = -1 # -1 means complete rounding (circle/oval)
    check_color = rgb(204, 136, 34)
    fail_color = rgb(204, 34, 34) # Color of the input field when failed to auth
    fail_text = <i>$FAIL <b>($ATTEMPTS)</b></i> # can include <i>, <b>, <u>
    fail_transition = 300 # transition time in ms between normal outer_color and fail_color
    capslock_color = rgb(204, 34, 34)
    numlock_color = rgb(34, 34, 204)
    bothlock_color = rgb(204, 34, 204) # when both locks are active
    invert_numlock = false # change color when numlock is off or on
    
    position = 0, -20
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label {
    monitor =
    text = cmd[update:1000] date "+%H:%M:%S"
    color = rgba(200, 200, 200, 1.0)
    font_size = 25
    font_family = Noto Sans Bold
    
    position = 0, 80
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label {
    monitor =
    text = $USER
    color = rgba(200, 200, 200, 1.0)
    font_size = 20
    font_family = Noto Sans
    
    position = 0, -100
    halign = center
    valign = center
}
</antArtifact>

Now let's update your lock script to be simpler since we're using the config file:

```bash
# Edit ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock
#!/usr/bin/bash
hyprlock
```

And update your hyprland.conf binding to remove the -c flag since we're using the default config location:
```bash
bind = CTRL ALT, L, exec, hyprlock
```

Key improvements:
1. Auto-focused input field with better positioning
2. Proper background blur with adjustable parameters
3. Clean clock and username display
4. Better visual feedback for caps/num lock
5. Customizable fail messages

You can adjust the `blur_passes`, `contrast`, and `brightness` values to get the exact look you want. The current settings should give you a nice frosted glass effect without being too resource-intensive.

Want to test out these changes? Just save the config and trigger the lock with Ctrl+Alt+L. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any of the visual elements!

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:47:43 UTC

 Gotcha - let's keep it organized with your other Hyprland configs. Here's the correction for file paths:

```bash
# Your current path is correct at ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf
# Just clean up the hyprland.conf binding to match:
bind = CTRL ALT, L, exec, hyprlock

# And simplify your lock script at ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock:
#!/usr/bin/bash
hyprlock
```

hyprlock will automatically look for its config in three places, in order:
1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hypr/hyprlock.conf`
2. `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf`  (which is what you're using)
3. `/usr/share/hypr/hyprlock.conf`

Would you like me to adjust any of those visual parameters in the config I shared earlier? You can just paste it into your existing `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf`.

</antArtifact>

Key improvements:
1. Added a Material Symbols placeholder in the input field
2. Added error handling with visual feedback
3. Added capslock warning
4. Slight background blur and dim for better text visibility
5. Live-updating clock (updates every second)

Also, I notice you have a status script. Want me to take a look at that too? And do you want to customize any of these changes?

**Human** - 2024-11-13 17:50:47 UTC

maybe this config isn't being called correctly then? my login  is just black with white text/fields

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:50:47 UTC

 Let's verify how hyprlock is being called in your system. There are several places we need to check:

1. In your hypridle.conf:
```bash
cat ~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf | grep "hyprlock"
```

2. In your hyprland.conf:
```bash
cat ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf | grep "hyprlock"
```

3. In your lock script:
```bash
cat ~/.config/hypr/scripts/lock
```

From what you're describing (black screen with white text), it sounds like either:
1. The config isn't being read at all
2. The background section isn't being processed correctly

Let's also verify the config path:
```bash
ls -l ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf
```

Could you run these commands and share the output? That will help us pinpoint exactly where the configuration chain is breaking.

Also, just to be thorough, could you try manually locking with:
```bash
hyprlock --config ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf
```
to see if that behaves differently from your current lock behavior?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-13 17:51:46 UTC

to be clear, i'm talking about the config that i've provided, i have yet to copy/paste the one you provided.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:51:46 UTC

 Ah, I see! I misunderstood - you were showing me your current config that's giving you a plain black background with white text/fields. Now I understand.

Looking at your config, this behavior makes sense because of these lines:
```bash
background {
    color = rgba(000000FF)  # Solid black background
    # path = screenshot     # Screenshot line is commented out
    # blur_size = 5        # Blur is commented out
    # blur_passes = 4      # Blur passes is commented out
}
```

Would you like to:
1. Enable the screenshot/blur functionality by uncommenting those lines?
2. Try a solid color other than black?
3. Use a custom wallpaper?

For example, to enable the screenshot blur effect, we'd just uncomment:
```bash
background {
    color = rgba(000000FF)
    path = screenshot
    blur_size = 5
    blur_passes = 4
}
```

What look are you going for? We can adjust from there!

---

**Human** - 2024-11-13 17:52:25 UTC

custom wallpaper and maybe blur?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:52:25 UTC

 I'll help you set that up! First, let's modify your background section to use a custom wallpaper with blur.

```bash
background {
    path = /home/blake/path/to/your/wallpaper.jpg  # Update this path
    blur_size = 5
    blur_passes = 3  # Lower passes = better performance
    brightness = 0.8  # Slightly dim the background
}
```

Hyprlock supports common image formats (jpg, png). Where do you keep your wallpapers? If you already have a wallpaper you're using with Hyprland/hyprpaper, we can use that same path.

We can test different blur values to find what looks good - `blur_size` sets how large the blur radius is, and `blur_passes` determines how smooth the blur appears. More passes look better but impact performance more.

Want to point me to your wallpaper location and we can set this up properly?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-13 17:55:55 UTC

i tell you what. i want you to surprise me. something slick, minimal, tasteful, maybe gruvboxy and if you need it my wallpapers are at /home/blake/pictures/walls/gruvboxyy  or if it's helpful i also have ~/.cache/swww/cache.txt

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:55:55 UTC

 Let me check what's in your swww cache as that's likely your current wallpaper:

```bash
cat ~/.cache/swww/cache.txt
```

In the meantime, let's enhance your hyprlock config with a gruvbox-inspired theme:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprlock-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Gruvbox Hyprlock Configuration">
# Gruvbox-inspired colors
$bg_color = rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)

$green = rgba(184, 187, 38, 1)
$yellow = rgba(250, 189, 47, 1)
$blue = rgba(131, 165, 152, 1)
$purple = rgba(211, 134, 155, 1)
$aqua = rgba(142, 192, 124, 1)
$dim = rgba(146, 131, 116, 0.7)

$font_family = Rubik Light
$font_material_symbols = Material Symbols Rounded

background {
    path = /home/blake/pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/gruv-waves.jpg  # We'll put a nice gruvbox wallpaper here
    blur_size = 6
    blur_passes = 3
    brightness = 0.8
    contrast = 1.1  # Slight contrast boost
    vibrancy = 0.2
    vibrancy_darkness = 0.0
}

input-field {
    monitor =
    size = 250, 50
    outline_thickness = 2
    dots_size = 0.1
    dots_spacing = 0.3
    outer_color = $blue
    inner_color = $bg_color
    font_color = $fg_color
    fade_on_empty = true
    placeholder_text = <span font_family="$font_material_symbols">lock</span>
    fail_color = $red
    fail_text = <i>nope...</i>
    capslock_color = $yellow
    position = 0, 20
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label { # Clock
    monitor =
    text = cmd[update:1000] date "+%H:%M"
    color = $fg_color
    font_size = 65
    font_family = $font_family
    position = 0, 300
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label { # Greeting
    monitor =
    text = hi $USER
    color = $dim
    font_size = 20
    font_family = $font_family
    position = 0, 240
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label { # "locked" text
    monitor =
    text = locked
    color = $blue
    font_size = 14
    font_family = $font_family
    position = 0, 65
    halign = center
    valign = bottom
}
</antArtifact>

This config:
1. Uses proper gruvbox colors with some transparency
2. Simplifies the interface while keeping it functional
3. Adds nice visual feedback for caps lock and failed attempts
4. Maintains a minimal, clean aesthetic
5. Uses blur and brightness adjustments for better readability

Could you share the contents of your swww cache? That way we can use your current wallpaper path or pick something nice from your gruvbox collection.

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:56:23 UTC

 Perfect! Let's modify the config to use your existing gruvbox wallpaper. I'll update the background section:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprlock-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Updated Gruvbox Hyprlock Configuration">
# Gruvbox-inspired colors
$bg_color = rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)

$yellow = rgba(250, 189, 47, 1)
$blue = rgba(131, 165, 152, 1)
$purple = rgba(211, 134, 155, 1)
$aqua = rgba(142, 192, 124, 1)
$dim = rgba(146, 131, 116, 0.7)

$font_family = Rubik Light
$font_material_symbols = Material Symbols Rounded

background {
    path = /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/cafe.jpg
    blur_size = 4  # Reduced blur for the cafÃ© image
    blur_passes = 2
    brightness = 0.7  # Darkened slightly for better contrast
    contrast = 1.1
    vibrancy = 0.2
    vibrancy_darkness = 0.0
}

input-field {
    monitor =
    size = 250, 50
    outline_thickness = 2
    dots_size = 0.1
    dots_spacing = 0.3
    outer_color = $blue
    inner_color = $bg_color
    font_color = $fg_color
    fade_on_empty = true
    placeholder_text = <span font_family="$font_material_symbols">lock</span>
    fail_color = $red
    fail_text = <i>nope...</i>
    capslock_color = $yellow
    position = 0, 20
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label { # Clock
    monitor =
    text = cmd[update:1000] date "+%H:%M"
    color = $fg_color
    font_size = 65
    font_family = $font_family
    position = 0, 300
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label { # Greeting
    monitor =
    text = hi $USER
    color = $dim
    font_size = 20
    font_family = $font_family
    position = 0, 240
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label { # "locked" text
    monitor =
    text = locked
    color = $blue
    font_size = 14
    font_family = $font_family
    position = 0, 65
    halign = center
    valign = bottom
}
</antArtifact>

I chose the cafÃ© wallpaper and:
1. Reduced blur since it's already a subtle image
2. Slightly darkened the background for better text contrast
3. Kept the gruvbox color scheme which should complement the cafÃ© image nicely

Try this out and we can adjust:
- Blur amount
- Brightness/contrast
- Text positions
- Color opacity

Just let me know what needs tweaking!

**Human** - 2024-11-13 17:56:31 UTC

what's the vim motion to yank to system clipboard?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 17:56:31 UTC

 In vim/neovim, to yank to system clipboard:

`"+y`

So for the entire file:
`gg"+yG`

Or in visual mode, select what you want then `"+y`

Note: This assumes you have clipboard support in your vim/neovim build. You can check with:
```bash
vim --version | grep clipboard
```

If you need clipboard support, you might want to install `xclip` or `wl-clipboard` (for Wayland, which you're using).

```bash
paru -S wl-clipboard
```

---

**Human** - 2024-11-13 18:12:10 UTC

your config has an issue.. i don't recall all of the error, but i had to hyprctl --instance 0 'keyword misc:allow_session_lock_restore 1'

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 18:12:10 UTC

 Ah, thank you for catching that! This is a known issue with hyprlock's session restore functionality. Let's document this properly so others don't run into the same issue:

```bash
# Add to hyprland.conf or run manually:
hyprctl --instance 0 keyword misc:allow_session_lock_restore 1
```

For persistence, you might want to add this line to your hyprland.conf:
```bash
misc {
    allow_session_lock_restore = true
}
```

This setting allows hyprlock to properly restore the session after unlocking. Without it, you might experience graphical glitches or session restore issues.

How's the lock screen working now? Any other issues to address?

---

**Human** - 2024-11-13 18:38:00 UTC

i honestly don't know what it is that's making the difference, but this config works fine. i just, y'know, don't really like how it looks. haha

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 18:38:00 UTC

 Ah, this is a much nicer setup! I see what you're doing here - using SF Pro Display Bold for that clean look, multi-monitor setup, and even song details. Very nice.

Key differences from what I suggested:
1. Per-monitor wallpapers (much better!)
2. Cleaner font choices with SF Pro Display Bold
3. Better positioned elements with more elegant spacing
4. Nice color opacity values for better readability
5. Smart use of date/time formatting
6. Integration with your music (that's cool!)

Do you want me to help you tune any specific aspects of this config? Maybe:
- Adjust the blur/brightness/contrast values
- Tweak the time/date format
- Modify the input field styling
- Play with the music display format

Also, I'm curious about your songdetail.sh script - is that pulling from mpd, spotify, or something else?

**Human** - 2024-11-13 18:45:50 UTC

is there a way to utilize the swww cache.txt to get this hyprlock line to handle the wallpapers from it? 

}
background {
    monitor =
    path = $HOME/.config/ml4w/cache/blurred_wallpaper.png   # only png supported for now
}

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 18:45:50 UTC

 Yes! We can create a small script to manage this. Since swww keeps track of the current wallpaper in cache.txt, we can use that to automatically blur and set the hyprlock wallpaper.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock
nvim ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock/wallblur.sh
```

Here's a script to handle it:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

# Get current wallpaper from swww cache
CURRENT_WALL=$(cat ~/.cache/swww/cache.txt | head -n 1)

# Create blur cache directory
CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/hyprlock"
mkdir -p "$CACHE_DIR"

# Generate blurred wallpaper if it doesn't exist or source has changed
BLUR_FILE="$CACHE_DIR/wall_blur.png"
CACHE_FILE="$CACHE_DIR/wall_cache"

if [ ! -f "$CACHE_FILE" ] || [ "$(cat "$CACHE_FILE")" != "$CURRENT_WALL" ]; then
    convert "$CURRENT_WALL" -blur 0x8 "$BLUR_FILE"
    echo "$CURRENT_WALL" > "$CACHE_FILE"
fi

echo "$BLUR_FILE"
```

Then modify your hyprlock.conf:

```bash
background {
    monitor =
    path = cmd[update:0] ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock/wallblur.sh
    blur_passes = 0  # We're already blurring in the script
}
```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock/wallblur.sh
```

This approach:
1. Reads the current wallpaper from swww's cache
2. Creates a blurred version using ImageMagick
3. Caches the blurred version to avoid reprocessing
4. Only regenerates when the wallpaper changes

You'll need ImageMagick installed:
```bash
paru -S imagemagick
```

Now hyprlock will automatically use a blurred version of whatever wallpaper swww is currently using!

**Human** - 2024-11-13 18:49:21 UTC

will i need to reload anything? adding and calling the config didn't seem to do the trick.

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 18:49:21 UTC

 Let's check each part:

1. First, verify the script is working:
```bash
# Test the script directly
~/.config/hypr/hyprlock/wallblur.sh
```

2. Check if the path is being created:
```bash
ls -l ~/.cache/hyprlock/wall_blur.png
```

3. Make sure the command syntax in hyprlock.conf is exactly right:
```bash
background {
    monitor =
    path = cmd[update:0] ~/.config/hypr/hyprlock/wallblur.sh
}
```

You don't need to reload Hyprland, as hyprlock reads its config each time it's launched. However, if the blurred wallpaper isn't showing up, try:

1. Kill any running hyprlock instances:
```bash
killall hyprlock
```

2. Test hyprlock directly:
```bash
hyprlock --debug
```

The `--debug` flag will show us if there are any errors in the config or wallpaper processing.

Let me know what outputs you get and we can debug from there!

---

**Human** - 2024-11-13 18:50:14 UTC

Well, we're close, but it did still work..

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 18:50:14 UTC

 We can update the script to use the newer `magick` command instead of the deprecated `convert`. Here's the updated version:

mkdir -p "$CACHE_DIR"

# Generate blurred wallpaper if it doesn't exist or source has changed
BLUR_FILE="$CACHE_DIR/wall_blur.png"
CACHE_FILE="$CACHE_DIR/wall_cache"

if [ ! -f "$CACHE_FILE" ] || [ "$(cat "$CACHE_FILE")" != "$CURRENT_WALL" ]; then
    magick "$CURRENT_WALL" -blur 0x8 "$BLUR_FILE"
    echo "$CURRENT_WALL" > "$CACHE_FILE"
fi

echo "$BLUR_FILE"
```

The script is still working (it created the blurred wallpaper), but let's use the newer command to avoid the warning. 

Is hyprlock now showing the blurred version of your current wallpaper? If not, let's see what `hyprlock --debug` shows us.

you know, for what it's worth, there's probably other issues i'm runnig into. i haphazardly grabbed the ml4w config and was tyring to make it work with my non ml4w setup:

 Ah, now I understand! Yes, that config is specifically designed for ML4W (Made Linux For Windows) which has its own specific setup and file structure. Let's clean this up to work with your setup.

Would you like me to:

1. Adapt this ML4W style (with the square wallpaper image and layout) to work with your system, or
2. Use our previous gruvbox-themed config but incorporate the working wallpaper blur script we just created?

For reference, the main issues with this config are:
- It's looking for files in `$HOME/.config/ml4w/cache/`
- It expects specific cache files like `square_wallpaper.png` and `blurred_wallpaper.png`
- It might be using fonts (Fira Semibold) that you don't have installed

Which direction would you prefer to go?

**Human** - 2024-11-13 18:58:01 UTC

since the ml4w one works, lets get some simple (non script) backgrounds working, and maybe add those gruuvy colors?

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 18:58:01 UTC

 I'll combine the working ML4W layout with gruvbox colors and a simpler background approach:

<antArtifact identifier="hyprlock-config" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="conf" title="Gruvbox ML4W-style Hyprlock Config">
# Gruvbox colors
$bg = rgb(282828)
$bg_dim = rgb(1d2021)
$fg = rgb(ebdbb2)
$red = rgb(cc241d)
$green = rgb(98971a)
$yellow = rgb(d79921)
$blue = rgb(458588)
$purple = rgb(b16286)
$aqua = rgb(689d6a)
$gray = rgb(928374)

general {
    ignore_empty_input = true
}

background {
    monitor =
    path = /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/cafe.jpg
    blur_size = 4
    blur_passes = 2
    brightness = 0.8
}

input-field {
    monitor =
    size = 200, 50
    outline_thickness = 3
    dots_size = 0.33
    dots_spacing = 0.15
    dots_center = true
    dots_rounding = -1
    outer_color = $blue
    inner_color = $bg_dim
    font_color = $fg
    fade_on_empty = true
    fade_timeout = 1000
    placeholder_text = <i>Password...</i>
    hide_input = false
    rounding = -1
    check_color = $green
    fail_color = $red
    fail_text = <i>$FAIL <b>($ATTEMPTS)</b></i>
    fail_transition = 300
    capslock_color = $yellow
    position = 0, -20
    halign = center
    valign = center
}

label {
    monitor =
    text = cmd[update:1000] echo "$TIME"
    color = $fg
    font_size = 55
    font_family = Rubik Light
    position = -100, 70
    halign = right
    valign = bottom
    shadow_passes = 5
    shadow_size = 10
}

label {
    monitor =
    text = $USER
    color = $fg
    font_size = 20
    font_family = Rubik Light
    position = -100, 160
    halign = right
    valign = bottom
    shadow_passes = 5
    shadow_size = 10
}

# If you want to keep the wallpaper circle
image {
    monitor =
    path = /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/cafe.jpg
    size = 280
    rounding = -1
    border_size = 4
    border_color = $blue
    position = 0, 200
    halign = center
    valign = center
}
</antArtifact>

Key changes:
1. Removed ML4W-specific paths
2. Added gruvbox colors as variables
3. Direct wallpaper paths to your cafe.jpg
4. Changed font to Rubik Light (install if needed)
5. Added nice color feedback for caps lock and failed attempts
6. Kept the ML4W layout but with gruvbox theming

If you want to try different wallpapers, just change both `path` entries (in `background` and `image` sections) to point to your desired wallpaper.

Want to adjust anything about the colors or layout?

multi-monitor handling.. this doesn't seem to be it.. 

background {
    {
      monitor = HDMI-A-1
      path = $HOME/.config/hypr/wallpapers/forest-foggy-misty-cloudy.png
    },
    {
      monitor = DP-3
      path = .config/hypr/wallpapers/flower-1.jpg
    } 
}

---

**Assistant** - 2024-11-13 19:25:41 UTC

 For hyprlock, monitor-specific backgrounds use a slightly different syntax. Here's the correct format:

```bash
background {
    monitor = HDMI-A-1
    path = /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/cafe.jpg
    blur_size = 4
    blur_passes = 2
}

background {
    monitor = DP-3
    path = /home/blake/Pictures/walls/gruvboxyy/4 - WVPTRwS.jpg
    blur_size = 4
    blur_passes = 2
}
```

You can check your monitor names with:
```bash
hyprctl monitors
```

Each monitor needs its own complete background block rather than nesting them. Want me to share the full config with proper multi-monitor support for all elements (labels, input fields, etc.)?
