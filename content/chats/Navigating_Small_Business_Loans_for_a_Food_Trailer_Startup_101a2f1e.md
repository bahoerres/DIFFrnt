Trying to distill some truth from what I imagine is mostly poor/dangerous tiktok advice. 

A popular theme on social platforms is basically how you can start an LLC, get your EIN and boom! 50k small business loan! 

A) it can't be that easy
B) what about 100 or 150k? 

C) I know and understand parts of this (LLC "credit score" is based on owners'(plural, if applicable), am looking for just a brief overview to get my ADHD brain moving and then we can go from there. 

Here's what I was thinking. I know of a food vending trailer for sale at 43k. I figure a loan of 100k would get me the trailer, up front costs and supplies of other/all varieties and ideally leave me with around 35-40k as my ass tarting bankroll and for things that come up in the first year.

 Let me help break this down realistically:

You're right - it's not as simple as TikTok makes it seem. Here's a clear picture:

1. New LLC + EIN â‰  Automatic Loan
The reality is that most traditional lenders want to see:
- 2+ years of business history
- Revenue records
- Good personal credit (usually 680+ minimum)
- Collateral in many cases
- Detailed business plan

For a new food trailer business, you might want to explore:

1. SBA (Small Business Administration) Loans
- More friendly to new businesses
- Lower down payments (10-20%)
- Better terms than traditional loans
- But still require personal credit check and business plan

2. Equipment Financing
- The trailer itself could serve as collateral
- Often easier to obtain than general business loans
- Typically requires 10-30% down payment

3. Personal Loans/Credit
- While not ideal, many food truck businesses start this way
- Combines personal credit cards, savings, and smaller loans

Your $100k plan for breakdown actually sounds quite reasonable:
$43k - Trailer
$20k - Initial inventory, permits, licenses, insurance
$37k - Operating capital

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these aspects? For example, I could explain more about SBA loans or help think through the business plan you'd need for any of these funding options.

Yeah, that would be a great direction to explore. I don't have a great credit history, but have options for co-signers. I figure this is a better way than adding someone to the LLC just to have their credit score?

 You're thinking strategically! Let's break this down:

Co-signer vs. LLC Member comparison:

Co-signer Route:
- They're only on the loan, not the business
- Cleaner ownership structure - it's 100% your business
- Protects their liability (they're only responsible for the loan, not business operations)
- Easier to modify or dissolve later
- They can help you qualify for better rates without getting involved in day-to-day operations

Adding Someone to LLC:
- More complicated legally
- They become partial owner with rights to profits
- They have legal say in business decisions
- More difficult to remove them later
- Can complicate taxes and profit distribution
- Their personal liability could extend beyond just the loan

For the SBA loan path with a co-signer, you'd typically need:
- Detailed business plan
- Financial projections
- Personal financial statement
- Resume showing related experience
- List of needed equipment
- Planned location/permits
- Down payment funds (usually 10-20%)

Would you like me to elaborate on the business plan components? That's often the make-or-break element for loan approval, even with a strong co-signer.

Also worth noting: Have you considered starting with a smaller operation to build business credit first? Some people start with a cart or smaller setup, establish revenue history, then scale up. This can make future financing easier and reduce the risk for both you and your co-signer.
