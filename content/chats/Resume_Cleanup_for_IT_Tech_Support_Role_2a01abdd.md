i'm on the fence about my experience at Fly Over the City. I was a 1099 there.. would "contractor" make the headline more appealing and then in the bullet points mention "multiple roles witihin the company including Courier, Dispatch and Office Administration"

 Sure, let's update that section to better highlight your diverse roles and responsibilities as a contractor. Here's the revised version:

is leading with technical skills, even before work experience, best practice?

---

**Assistant** - 2024-05-13 01:12:28 UTC

 The order of sections on a resume can vary depending on your specific situation and the job you're applying for. However, in most cases, it's best to lead with your professional experience before listing your technical skills, especially if you have relevant work experience.

Here's why:

1. Employers often prioritize work experience over skills because it demonstrates your ability to apply your knowledge in real-world situations.

2. Starting with your professional experience allows you to highlight your achievements and the impact you've made in previous roles.

3. Your work experience section provides context for your technical skills, showing how you've used them in practice.

However, there are some exceptions where leading with technical skills might be appropriate:

1. If you're applying for a highly technical role and your skills are the most important qualifier.

2. If you're a recent graduate or have limited work experience in the field you're applying to.

In your case, since you have relevant work experience, it's generally better to lead with your professional experience and then follow up with your technical skills section. This way, employers can quickly see your background and then understand how your skills complement your experience.

have a look at this original. it seems there was some bits that got translated funny in the game of telephone that has been played by these edits. pay specific mind to the consulting/freelance section. now, i suppose it would kind of make sense to leverage the fact that i did both culinary and IT/networking consulting during this time? mostly troubleshooting/analysis/documentation for friends with restaurants that were having issues with some of their devices.
